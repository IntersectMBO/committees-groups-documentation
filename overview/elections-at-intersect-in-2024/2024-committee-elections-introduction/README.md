# 2024 Committee elections Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is currently being updated, in the interest of transparency we are working on this live to ensure the membership community have the information as soon as possible. &#x20;

## Why are we electing committee members?

Intersect is a member-based organization (MBO), supporting the future development and governance of the Cardano blockchain.&#x20;

Intersect was established in January 2024 with seven core committees being staffed from individual and organization members with support from Intersect professional staff. During Intersect's bootstrapping phase, these committees have been filled by those who raised their hands, and have brought us such a long way and have got us to a stable position.&#x20;

## Evolving committee representation&#x20;

Thanks to them we are now at a phase of maturity where we can take the next step and open up opportunities to join committees across the membership.&#x20;

Opening on September 9th, members of Intersect\* can apply to join our core committees. All candidates will be voted upon by the wider membership base during October (see "[key dates](../key-dates-and-notes.md)" for more information).

{% hint style="info" %}
\*Members of Intersect are those who have joined or renewed their membership for $10 as an individual or $1,000 as an enterprise. "Associates" are not eligible to stand. You must be a member on or by 27th September.

## Staggered approach

We are going to take a phased approach to electing the committee members to ensure no momentum is lost. 50% of the seats for each committee will be elected as part of the Annual Members Meeting (AMM) Events in October 2024 and the remaining 50% will be elected in April 2025.

## The voting approach

This will be the first time we elect committee members at this scale.

Summon Platform, providing back-end and on-chain tooling for voting.  More information can be found [here](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-elections-2024/overview/key-guides/how-to-vote-in-the-intersect-elections)

Unlike Cardano mainnet voting, Intersect adopts "one member, one vote" (not stake based).

## What you need to know

We have compiled all the information we feel that you will need to know along with the key dates and frequently asked questions.  All of this can be found within this area of our knowledge base.  We will also be holding a number of[ engagement events](../engagement-events.md) and posting key messages across our social media platforms.

We have set up a [Discord Election Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1136727663583698984/1270677346743222337) so you can post any questions you may have.  You can also email [karen.wickham@intersectmbo.org](mailto:karen.wickham@intersectmbo.org).
