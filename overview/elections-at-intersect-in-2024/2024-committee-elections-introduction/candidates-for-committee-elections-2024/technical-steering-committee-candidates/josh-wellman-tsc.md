<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I’ve learned how to transform my weaknesses into superpowers.

I have extensive experience with company-wide collaboration, Support, and community-building--growing out processes and infrastructure with intention.

Customers and Employers are thirsty for balanced transformation, real improvements, transparency, and efficiency.

I have a broad range of experience, including enterprise pipeline assurance, lab architecture, ‘Transfer of Information (TOI)’ production and distribution, and grass-roots community growth.

I have a good understanding about how the Internet and Technology Companies of today work, and can see how this initial wave of Blockchain, AI, Quantum Computing, and NanoTechnology is pushing us into an age of Transparency, Inclusive Diversity, Abundance, Turmoil, and Truth.

My unique exposure and experience give me a focused vision into the future, which I’m using with intentionality to bring about comprehensive consciousness.
