<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I co-chair the Intersect Parameter Sub-Committee, and serve on the Intersect Technical Steering Committee, Security Working Group, and Hard Fork Working Group. I interact regularly with Intersect employees and members as part of my role as Head of Engineering for Cardano at IOG. I have helped establish Intersect as a functioning entity. In addition to my institutional membership via IOG, I am fully committed to Intersect as a personal founding member.

Today, Cardano is an established and respected blockchain, offering advanced proof-of-stake capabilities, staking rewards for Ada holders, smart contract capabilities, while operating a highly reliable globally distributed and decentralised network. Importantly, it also has a highly advanced and decentralised community governance system. As Head of Software Engineering for Cardano at IOG, and now IOE, I have been at the heart of this development, from the rollout of the Incentivised Testnet in 2019 to the delivery of the Chang Hard Fork earlier this month, and for the forthcoming Chang+1 delivery that will complete CIP-1694 and enable on-chain decentralised representation.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I pledge to use my detailed technical knowledge of Cardano, my long-standing research background, my strong software development background, and my connections with the Cardano ecosystem, to ensure that the best possible outcomes are achieved for Cardano, so that it maintains its unique position and influence within the blockchain sphere.

My immediate plans are to work as part of the Technical Steering Committee to construct a robust and secure technical work plan for 2025 that will enable the delivery of important new features for Cardano. These will be driven by community needs, requirements and priorities, and may include initial work on Ouroboros Leios (to increase chain capacity)

Ouroboros Peras/Anti-Grinding (to improve transaction finality)

new pricing and other mechanisms to manage on-chain demand

mechanisms to assist smaller stake pool operators

extensions and improvements to the Voltaire governance system in the light of experience with the current system

new work on proof-of-useful work. It will also include all the work that is necessary to maintain a sustainable and well-operating blockchain, including security, robustness and reliability improvements as part of a large and successful open source project.

<details>

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I have achieved a high level of technical knowledge and experience of Cardano and its ecosystem over a 5 year period. I was a founding author of CIP-1694 and am firmly committed to the principles and practice of open community governance. I have provided Intersect with knowledge and advice that has enabled it to become established. I will continue to do this so it achieves the success that is needed to maintain Cardano as a leading blockchain. I have strong connections within the community, including with SPOs, the CF, Emurgo, the Cardano developer community, and leading DApp developers.

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

I am employed by Input Output Engineering (IOE), a subsidiary of Input Output Global (IOG)

<summary>Are you currently in receipt of or previously received any Intersect or Cardano funding or grant?</summary>

Not personally. IOE has received Intersect funding to carry out development work on CIP-1694 and other activities.
