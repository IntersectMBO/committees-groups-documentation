<details>

<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am very interested in being able to have both a say and a potential impact in the relatively short term development path of the Cardano Ecosystem (i.e. the coming year).&#x20;

As I feel I can bring to the table some perspectives and ideas that may not otherwise be raised around potential directions to take over the next years' development cycle, and how to implement them.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have served as a part of the Governance Parameters Working Group since December 2023 and was a co-author of a Report that came out of this Group relating to the Initial Recommendations for Governance Parameters Settings as a part of Cardano's CIP-1694 implementation.

More recently, I have been actively participating in discussions, and attending meetings, within the both the API and CLI Working Group and the Ledger Working Group.

I am currently a Non-Custodial Co-Management SysOps Engineer (Tech Janitor) for 3 Stake Pools on Cardano.

Meaning I help secure and maintain Client Servers, and Cardano Software setups, but _do not have any access_ to my Clients' Cold Keys for their Pools.

Nor do I own any part of my Clients' Core Infrastructures, they rent or deploy their own VPS or Baremetal Servers for me to then maintain.

I regularly provide Pro Bono support to people who wish to set up their own Development Infrastructures for Cardano, or who wish to set up an SPO Infrastructure.

I have World Mobile EarthNode Operator Clients and will be providing the same style of Non-Custodial SysOps Engineer Services to them once WMC/Aya Chain Infrastructures go Live (currently in Testnet).

I am a Cardano Keystone Wallet Ambassador and am working with them to ensure full compatibility with Cardano Ecosystem CIP Standards where possible. I will be a tester of their upcoming Firmware implementations to give feedback on the UX/UI experience for Cardano Users as a part of this Role.
