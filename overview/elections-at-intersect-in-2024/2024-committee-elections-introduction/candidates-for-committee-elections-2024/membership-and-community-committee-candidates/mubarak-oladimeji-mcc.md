<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I am Mubarak Oladimeji, also known as Kit Willow on Discord and X (Twitter) I have been following the Cardano ecosystem for a while but I didn’t take a deep dive until Project Catalyst Fund 11 where I participated as a community reviewer, and finished with a 100% approval rate. Naturally, I was very much interested in diving deeper into the Cardano ecosystem and I started frequenting communities that were renowned to be building on the Cardano Blockchain, some of which include&#x20;

Remostart and Smart Contract Audit to mention a few. After Fund 11, I aligned with a friend and colleague of mine who was also invested in the Cardano ecosystem. Together, with the help of other core members, we founded NexTrend Labs and I assumed the role of the Chief Operating Officer (COO). My work with NexTrend Labs has been rewarding as we have been able to establish a functional Cardano-based community in Nigeria and achieved some milestones, including hosting a DReP workshop at the University of Lagos, even without receiving funds from Intersect.&#x20;

I participated in Project Catalyst, Fund 12 as well, both as a project owner (courtesy of NexTrend Labs) and as a community reviewer. Though I was saddened by the fact that none of the projects I submitted by proxy through NexTrend Labs were funded, I did not let it deter me from contributing further to the Cardano ecosystem. I finished the community review process of Fund 12 with an approval rate of 90%, effectively earning my place as an L1 reviewer. I can say that I eagerly look forward to the start of Fund 13. I got really involved with Intersect very early in 2024 and joined the Intersect Discord server. I have been an active participant in real-life Intersect events organized in my region, Lagos Nigeria. The first of which was the Intersect Meetup, and then the DReP Workshop, both hosted by Remostart. I also organized and hosted a DReP event, as the COO and a Team Member of NexTrend Labs, which we hosted without receiving grants from Intersect or any other bodies. Likewise, I was also a participant in my region’s Constitutional Workshop and was honoured to be elected as one of the delegates to represent my region at the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires. I am an active participant in Intersect, mostly working with and in alignment with the Transparency and Marketing Working Groups. Also, I have been — and still — is an active presence and contributor in Intersect on Discord, X and so on, operating under the alias Kit Willow. I have joined many space calls, zoom and google meetings to contribute my fair share in bettering not just Intersect, but the Cardano ecosystem as a whole. Thank you.

As a member of this committee, I plan to help facilitate the onboarding and education of new community members, through the organization of several engaging events. Also, I plan on integrating a survey approach towards getting the general community's opinions and perspectives on important matters which may help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Membership and Community Committee

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

As an individual member of Intersect and the Cardano ecosystem. I am dedicated towards the goal of enhancing effective community engagements. I aim to be a voice for people of diverse origins, with distinct views yet united under a common goal or vision. As the COO, of NexTrend Labs, I have some of the required experience and expertise in building an engaging community and will leverage that in full during my operational service as a committee member. If I am elected as a committee member, and entrusted with a certain level of decision-making, I’ll ensure that I maintain a degree of integrity and transparency towards myself and the general Cardano community. I am an active member of the community, on several working groups, Discord and X(Twitter) and I’m invested in the betterment of Intersect and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole. I do hope you consider voting for me. Thank you.
