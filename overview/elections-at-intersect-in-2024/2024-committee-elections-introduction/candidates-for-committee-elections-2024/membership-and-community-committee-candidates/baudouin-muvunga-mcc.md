<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been part of the Cardano community since 2021 and I now lead a community in the Nyiragongo territory in the DRC. I have been a community evaluator at Catalyst since Fund 9. I have been passionate about Cardano since I first met it. I now mentor young people in Web3 and blockchain matters, mainly integration with Cardano. I have already received support several times from Token MITHR (www.mithr.io), of which I am an ambassador in the DRC, but also from Intersect MBO to organize a meetup, face to face in June 2024 (https://updciongandintersectmboenglish.blogspot.com/2024/07/event-on-june-29-2024-in-nyiragongo.html).
