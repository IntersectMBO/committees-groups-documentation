<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

If selected for the Membership and Community Committee (MCC), I am particularly interested in contributing to community support, education, and outreach efforts. With my extensive experience in organizing over 10 workshops and educational events across Ecuador and Paraguay, focused on blockchain and Cardano, I believe I can help enhance community engagement and knowledge-sharing within the Cardano ecosystem. My background has equipped me with the skills to create educational content that resonates with diverse audiences and effectively communicates the value of Cardano’s technology.

In this role, I aim to strengthen the outreach and education initiatives of the MCC, ensuring they are inclusive, accessible, and aligned with the broader mission of Intersect and the Cardano community. By focusing on educational programs and support for new and existing members, we can empower individuals and institutions to contribute meaningfully to Cardano’s development.

Additionally, I would like to take an active role in overseeing community grants and allocations, ensuring that funding is distributed fairly and strategically to projects that will have a significant impact on the ecosystem. This aligns with my experience in facilitating grant proposals and contributing to Fund initiatives like the Ayllu decentralized education platform. My goal is to help create a more transparent, collaborative, and thriving Cardano community by fostering meaningful connections, supporting education, and ensuring that community-driven projects receive the resources they need to succeed.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have extensive experience within the Cardano ecosystem, particularly in the areas of education and technical development. Over the past few years, I’ve organized more than 10 workshops in schools and universities across Ecuador and Paraguay, where I’ve been teaching people about blockchain technology and how Cardano operates. I also had the opportunity to actively participate in two constitutional workshops, one in Paraguay and another in Bolivia, where I contributed to the discussions on creating a minimum viable constitution for Cardano.

Additionally, I was part of the Ayllu decentralized education platform, which aims to educate people about Cardano. On the technical side, I have experience in setting up Cardano nodes and am currently enhancing my skills by learning Aiken, a programming language for Cardano.

I’m involved in two major initiatives through Project Catalyst: the Fund11 "Blockchain Voting System" and the Fund12 "Digital Voter ID using Atala Prism."

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If elected to the Membership and Community Committee (MCC), I pledge to focus on several key initiatives aimed at enhancing member engagement and community support within the Cardano ecosystem. One of my primary goals is to formalize the operations of the existing Marketing Working Group, ensuring that their strategies for promoting Cardano’s values and projects are effectively implemented and widely disseminated. This will involve refining their approach and fostering collaboration among members and organizations to ensure cohesive messaging and outreach efforts, ultimately increasing Cardano's visibility and attracting new members.

In addition to enhancing marketing efforts, I am committed to decentralizing our community hub by developing more local hubs rather than limiting our focus to regional ones. By empowering local communities, we can foster stronger connections and more tailored support that addresses specific needs and interests. This approach will not only enhance member engagement but also ensure that diverse voices are heard within the Cardano ecosystem.

Moreover, I propose the establishment of a Community Sentiment Research Working Group that will regularly assess member feedback and community sentiment. Actively gathering insights on members' experiences and opinions will enable us to better understand their needs and concerns, guiding our initiatives and policies effectively.

Furthermore, I will advocate for a more formal and transparent grant allocation system that directs funds toward impactful projects aligned with Cardano’s goals, complete with clear criteria and open communication throughout the application process. I aim to improve communication channels to keep members informed about opportunities, resources, and developments. Additionally, I am dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion through targeted outreach initiatives that engage underrepresented groups in the blockchain and Cardano spaces. By decentralizing our community hub and implementing these initiatives, I hope to create a vibrant, educated, and engaged community that significantly contributes to the growth and sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

The community should vote for me because I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and commitment to enhancing the Cardano ecosystem. My extensive background in educational initiatives within the Cardano community, combined with my active participation in workshops and events, demonstrates my dedication to fostering knowledge and engagement among members. I understand the importance of building strong local hubs that can empower individual voices and create a decentralized, vibrant community.

Additionally, I have a proven track record of collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders, which positions me well to facilitate effective communication and coordination within the Membership and Community Committee. My focus on formalizing the operations of the Marketing Working Group will help streamline efforts to promote Cardano, ensuring that our messaging is cohesive and impactful.

Moreover, my commitment to establishing a Community Sentiment Research Working Group highlights my dedication to understanding and addressing the needs of our members. I believe in the power of community input to drive positive change and innovation within our ecosystem.

Lastly, I am passionate about advocating for a transparent grant allocation system that ensures funds are directed toward meaningful projects, fostering trust and accountability. By voting for me, the community will choose a candidate who is not only invested in the success of Cardano but also dedicated to creating an inclusive and thriving environment for all members. Together, we can enhance our community's impact and ensure that Cardano continues to grow and evolve in alignment with our shared values.
