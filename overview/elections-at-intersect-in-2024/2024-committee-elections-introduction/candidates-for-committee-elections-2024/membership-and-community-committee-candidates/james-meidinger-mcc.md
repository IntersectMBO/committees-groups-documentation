Have been a part of Intersect as a non paying associate since inception, also have worked here and there with the Stable coin Committee as well as interacting with Intersect discord. As far as Cardano, have been following it since 2018 and a active member since 2019. Current roles are:

1. Cardano Over Coffee since 2020
2. Community manager and principal team member for a token distribution project, based around the Custom submit api which included facilitating over 50 seperate spo's and their relay node, this offered a different access point for individual users and dapps to connect to the network outside of Blockfrost.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I pledge to uphold the Cardano articles of the constitution and to insure that everyone who now, or in the future wish to take back their self sovereignty. I was onboarded into this community by Charles's white board video and the idea of pushing power to the edges has never felt more important then it does right now.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

If you want someone who has been and will always be a free thinker, someone who believes in Self Sovereignty and the idea that every voice should be equally heard, someone who believes that 'Cant be Evil" is a obtainable goal and everyone no matter their intellectual or financial status has something to offer the world. Then vote for me to become a member of Membership and Community Committee.
