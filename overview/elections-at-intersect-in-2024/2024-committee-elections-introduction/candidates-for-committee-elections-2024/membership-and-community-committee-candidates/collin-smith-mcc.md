<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been participating in Intersect as a member for most of the last year. I am also a founder of MAV100 and I have been a part of building the intersect DRep training program and we have piloted this project instructing kids in several school districts about DRep training and blockchain principles in general.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

The true value proposition of the Cardano Blockchain is decentralized consensus and the ability to organize our communities. I pledge to design and implement tools that allow communities to use the blockchain to organize themselves in such a way that we protect ourselves from the fiat abusers and the centralized powers that dominate the world. I will provide leadership on the MCC that mobilizes Intersect and the Cardano Blockchain around a decentralized community based adoption approach. I will allow communities to organize in a decentralized way to take back control of key community infrastructure. I will provide tools communities can use to provide decentralized and locally responsive education.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I understand the true value of the blockchain to our communities. I know how we can use it as a tool to decentralize long standing centralized social structures. Used as infrastructure the blockchain allows us to build new decentralized business and local governance models. We can use the blockchain to fund the transfer of knowledge and skills to our students in our schools.

I have a detailed plan to integrate Cardano directly into communities. Society is defined by how it organizes it's social structure and how it educates it's people. We can organize community owned business using MBO/DAO legal entities that will get more information to more people and allow the companies to make more valuable decisions. We will build these organizations using the Cardano Blockchain and these businesses will support the blockchain the same way they support other community infrastructure like roads and power lines. We can then use the SPOs to support local education through learn to earn programs that get new people involved in the blockchain and directly into governance.
