I've been a Cardano holder since 2018, and I've followed its journey closely ever since. After becoming an Intersect member in June, I’ve really come to appreciate the community

it's full of passionate, like-minded people who are always thinking about what’s next. There’s a real drive to improve the ecosystem and spread awareness of Cardano, step by step, which I find incredibly inspiring. As this was lacking for a long time.

I currently hold a management position in a logistics company, where I’m responsible for coordinating people and ensuring that both customers and employees are well supported. In addition, as a sales professional, I’ve developed strong interpersonal skills, which help me build relationships and effectively communicate with diverse teams. These experiences in leadership, team management, and relationship-building would allow me to contribute meaningfully to the committee.
