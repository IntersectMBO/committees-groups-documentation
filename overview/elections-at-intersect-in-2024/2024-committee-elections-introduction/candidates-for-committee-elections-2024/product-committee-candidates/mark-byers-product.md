<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

As co-founder of entityOS.cloud in 2000, I have extensive experience in bringing new technology to market and, through my work at entityOS, in organisational design. I have a deep understanding of the Cardano technology stack, and I would seek any role that best utilises my experience and skills.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been an active member of the Cardano community for over 5 years. I am a co-founder of selfdriven.foundation, a community self-actuating platform that utilises the Cardano blockchain. The selfdriven Foundation supports several community sites, including cardano.build, cardanowallets.io, and cardano.ninja.&#x20;

I have been involved with Intersect as a founding member of the MCC, and more recently as its co-chair, making me a member of both the Advisory Board and the Steering Committee. I am stepping down from the MCC co-chair position to focus on my potential election to the Product Committee.
