I have been building on Cardano for over 5 years. I started as a Blockchain Developer at Gimbalabs, then served as the CTO of Nucast. I am also the VP of Engineering at TrivolveTech. We have introduced Cardano to thousands of developers in India through Cardanocodex and brought an Indian state government onto Cardano to build their forensics management solution. Additionally, I have played a pivotal role in several successful Cardano projects. I have led and delivered the technology for 10+ successful projects funded by Catalyst.
