<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in serving as a voice for governance and community engagement within the Steering Committee. My experience in launching the CoinCeylon x Intersect Hub, the first of its kind in South Asia, has given me a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing local communities as they integrate with global blockchain governance structures.

I believe that my hands-on experience in organizing workshops, events, and education initiatives, as well as my role in promoting governance participation through the Workshops, positions me well to contribute in this space. I’m keen to bring forward ideas that enhance community involvement and drive innovation, while ensuring that the core values of decentralization and transparency are upheld in every decision.

I would like to focus on fostering collaboration between different committees and promoting member-driven initiatives that can make governance more accessible and empowering for all Cardano stakeholders.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

My experience within the Intersect and Cardano ecosystems has been shaped by a strong focus on fostering governance, education, and innovation, coupled with strong foundation of marketing and promotions not only within Sri Lanka but across the broader South Asian region and around the world. I have been immersed in Cardano’s ecosystem since its formative days, playing a pivotal role in introducing Cardano to a wider audience. As the Founder and CEO of Coin Ceylon, the 1st Blockchain Technology company in Sri Lanka my journey began with launching Sri Lanka's first-ever Cardano stake pool, which promoted decentralization and provided local users with a direct connection to the Cardano network. This was a pivotal moment in raising awareness about the benefits of Cardano and offering local communities a hands-on experience with blockchain technology.

Building on this foundation, I led the creation of Sri Lanka's first Blockchain Forum and the first multi-purpose CNFT collection, ‘Yakka.’ Through these initiatives, we bridged the gap between traditional art and blockchain, creating new opportunities for local creators and expanding Cardano’s reach within the creative and tech sectors. We developed our own minting service, which further showcased the practical and cultural applications of Cardano's technology. Our efforts with CNFTs have demonstrated how blockchain can be utilized to create value in both cultural heritage and modern digital platforms. Education has always been a core part of my mission, which is why I’ve focused heavily on educational initiatives surrounding blockchain. Through Coin Ceylon, I've been a part of organizing workshops, seminars, and town halls aimed at breaking down complex blockchain concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences. We’ve worked towards integrating blockchain into local universities, building strong ties with academic institutions to nurture the next generation of blockchain innovators. This educational drive aligns with Cardano’s broader vision of empowering communities through knowledge and creating opportunities for people to contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem.

A significant milestone in my journey was the launch of the CoinCeylon x Intersect Hub in Sri Lanka, which marked the establishment of the first Intersect Hub in South Asia, and the 3rd one around the world. This hub has become a central point for Cardano governance, education, and community engagement in the region. By hosting regular town halls, Constitutional Workshops, and other physical events, we’ve created a platform where local stakeholders can actively contribute to shaping Cardano’s future. This initiative directly aligns with the Age of Voltaire and demonstrates how grassroots governance can empower communities to take ownership of blockchain innovation.

In addition to these local efforts, I have also participated in global Cardano events, including international conferences and workshops, where I’ve shared our local experiences and learned from other blockchain leaders. This global interaction has enriched my understanding of Cardano's governance and technological innovations, allowing me to bring back valuable insights to the community.

These experiences have given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Cardano and Intersect. My deep involvement in both the governance and educational spheres, as well as my contributions to real-world applications and blockchain services, positions me to continue driving meaningful, sustainable growth within the ecosystem. I believe that the lessons learned from these initiatives, combined with my commitment to transparency and community empowerment, Marketing and Promotional experience would allow me to serve effectively as a Board member, helping guide Intersect and Cardano toward long-term success.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

When elected to the Steering Committee, I will focus on three key areas to drive growth, collaboration, and meaningful impact across Intersect and the Cardano ecosystem:

Enhancing Community Engagement and Growth: I pledge to create new pathways for deeper community engagement, not just through governance but also through events, partnerships, and collaborations. I plan to work closely with global hubs, to ensure that every community member feels empowered to contribute to Cardano’s growth. Whether it's through educational events or local initiatives, building a strong, connected community will be a priority.

Promoting Education and Awareness: I plan to advocate for the development of educational resources that simplify and demystify Cardano and blockchain technology, By offering training, workshops, and clear communication, we can help members better understand their role within the ecosystem and make more informed decisions that benefit the entire network.

Marketing, Outreach, and Visibility: One of my key goals is to raise the visibility of Intersect and Cardano by driving marketing initiatives that highlight success stories, emerging projects, and local efforts. By leveraging digital platforms, local media, and global networks, we can elevate the profile of Cardano and attract new members, developers, and stakeholders to our ecosystem.

I’m dedicated to ensuring Intersect continues to be a thriving, inclusive community that fosters innovation, collaboration, and real-world impact across the Cardano ecosystem.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

The community should vote for me because I bring a strong blend of practical experience, strategic thinking, and a deep-rooted commitment to the success of Cardano’s future. Over the years, I’ve worked tirelessly to bridge the gap between blockchain innovation and community involvement. As the Founder / CEO of Coin Ceylon, I’ve led initiatives that have not only promoted Cardano’s technology but have also empowered local communities to actively engage and benefit from the ecosystem.

My work in launching the first Intersect Hub in South Asia and hosting large-scale events such as the Local Cardano summits, Constitutional Workshops and educational initiatives has given me valuable insights into what drives community participation. I understand the importance of listening to the grassroots, understanding the needs of various stakeholders, and working toward real-world applications that benefit everyone—from developers to everyday users.

I’m a firm believer in making governance accessible, transparent, and practical. I’ve seen first-hand how active community participation can shape a more inclusive and resilient Cardano ecosystem. When elected, I will champion the voices of those often overlooked, push for member-driven initiatives, and ensure that the Steering Committee’s decisions are aligned with the long-term success of both the Cardano network and its diverse global community.
