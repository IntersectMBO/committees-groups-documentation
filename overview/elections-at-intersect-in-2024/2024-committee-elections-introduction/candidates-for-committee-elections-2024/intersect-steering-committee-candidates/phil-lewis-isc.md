<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been contributing to Cardano since 2018, including pre-Shelley Jormungandr node testing, Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), and the Ariob Incubator Bootcamp, an iceaddis/IOG program for startups building on Cardano.&#x20;

I have been involved in all aspects of Catalyst since Fund 0, including being funded in Funds 5 and 11. I have run many in person community meetups and Cardano Summit events. I have contributed to different Intersect working groups, including as chair of the Stablecoins Working Group. I was also selected as a DRep Pioneer Program leader to deliver workshops for community members who wish to learn how to become a DRep.&#x20;

I am a member of the Eastern Cardano Council, who were recently elected to the Interim Constitutional Committee. Also, as the Co-Founder of Empowa and other projects building on Cardano, I have a long term investment in the Cardano community, and therefore appreciate the importance of ensuring that Cardanoâ€™s capabilities continue to evolve and grow to support new initiatives.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I have a Computer Science degree, am a TOGAF certified Enterprise Architect and have worked in the IT industry for over 25 years. Enterprise architecture not only considers the use of technology for organisational change, but explores how teams can be structured to deliver desired outcomes and achieve goals.&#x20;

In addition to my contributions within Intersect I also have previous experience in other member based organisations, including as the President of a sporting club for 5 years. During that time I was involved in ensuring legal compliance, implementing constitution changes and supporting committees in the delivery of the organisation's objectives.
