<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

The position of Chairman of the Intersect Steering Committee aligns perfectly with my leadership experience and my vision for decentralizing power within governance. As the founder of Next Trend Labs and with my background in project and research management, I bring extensive skills in strategy, coordination, and operations that are essential for the success of this role. As Chairman, my focus would be to ensure that the Steering Committee effectively fulfills its mission of aligning and guiding the efforts of all Intersect committees to make Cardano governance clear, accessible, and truly community-owned.

However, chairing meetings alone is not enough. As Chairman, I would prioritize ensuring that every committee and stakeholder under Intersect has a voice in the decision-making process. This is crucial to my belief in decentralized governance, where authority is shared, and decisions are made collectively. By fostering open dialogue and transparent communication, I would work to ensure that all committees are actively engaged, contributing to a governance framework that reflects the diverse interests of the Cardano ecosystem.

Additionally, the Steering Committee plays a critical role in coordinating the work of all committees, and I am committed to facilitating this coordination effectively. I would work closely with not only the Civics Committee but also the other key committees to ensure that their efforts are in line with the broader goals of IntersectMBO. By ensuring that governance initiatives are aligned with the long-term vision for sustainability, decentralization, and open-source collaboration, I would help steer the collective efforts toward promoting stability and transparency within the Cardano ecosystem. In doing so, I would contribute to creating a governance structure that supports organic growth and long-term success for Cardano.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I joined the Cardano ecosystem in early 2022 through Remostart, actively contributing to the growth and governance of the ecosystem. My primary involvement has been with Project Catalyst, where I participated as a community reviewer and project proposer. Though my three proposals were unsuccessful, these experiences offered me valuable insights into what the community values in its voting process. They also deepened my understanding and sense of responsibility toward improving the Cardano platform, preparing me for future opportunities within this space.

One of my most significant learning moments was discovering the Cardano Intersect, which came to my attention through a Town Hall meeting hosted by Wada Global. The brief mention of governance and the DRep pioneer program piqued my curiosity, prompting me to explore further. I quickly immersed myself in the Cardano Intersect community, joining their Discord and engaging in meaningful conversations on transparency. This dialogue allowed me to form valuable connections while contributing to the ecosystem’s ongoing governance discussions.

As a passionate advocate for Cardano’s development, I have actively participated in various Intersect programs, including DRep workshops and the recently concluded Constitutional Workshop. Notably, I took the initiative to sponsor and host a DRep workshop in Nigeria, with support from Intersect. This event provided training materials and raised awareness, highlighting my dedication to fostering a well-informed and engaged community.

My commitment to governance transparency and mass adoption of Cardano has led me to work closely with the Government Transparency SIG and contribute to the Marketing Working Group's proposal for Cardano’s 2025 strategy. Through these collective efforts, I aim to ensure the Cardano ecosystem continues to thrive through enhanced transparency, community oversight, and widespread adoption.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If elected as a member of the Intersect Steering Committee, my primary focus will be on fostering decentralized governance across all committees. The Steering Committee’s role in connecting various committees to the Intersect Board requires a strong commitment to ensuring that decision-making is distributed, fair, and community-driven. I will work to ensure that the voices of all committees are heard and that no single entity dominates the decision-making process. This will foster trust within the ecosystem and promote transparent outcomes that align with the collective vision of Intersect and the broader Cardano community.

To achieve effective alignment and coordination between committees, I will prioritize open communication and collaboration. By facilitating regular cross-committee meetings, maintaining feedback loops, and ensuring transparent documentation of decisions, the Steering Committee can effectively unify the efforts of all committees and drive Intersect forward. I will also advocate for strong governance tools, such as on-chain voting, to streamline decision-making processes and ensure that the broader community’s input is integrated into our governance structures. Clear accountability measures will be crucial to maintaining integrity at every level of governance.

I am committed to ensuring that Intersect remains sustainable and resilient for the long term. By aligning the work of the Steering Committee with the broader goals of Intersect, I will work to foster an inclusive and collaborative environment where innovation and open-source collaboration thrive. My focus will be on promoting transparency, stability, and community participation to ensure that the governance structure we create supports Cardano’s continued growth and success. Through these efforts, I aim to contribute to a governance model that drives the entire Intersect ecosystem forward in a decentralized and community-driven manner.

The community should vote for me because my focus is on serving the community, ensuring that IntersectMBO and the broader Cardano ecosystem remain inclusive, transparent, and community-driven. My priority is to make sure that all members, whether long-standing or new, have equal access to opportunities and benefits within IntersectMBO. This includes creating systems that ensure fairness in decision-making, access to resources, and governance participation.

To serve the community, I pledge to champion an open and collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and where participation is encouraged across all levels. By focusing on decentralization and equitable access to opportunities, I will work to ensure that community-led initiatives continue to shape the future of the Cardano ecosystem and that IntersectMBO's processes remain transparent and fair for all members.

Through this commitment, I aim to foster trust, accountability, and a sense of belonging within the community. Voting for me means voting for a community-first approach, where collaboration and transparency guide our governance decisions and where everyone has a fair chance to contribute and benefit from the growth of the Cardano ecosystem.
