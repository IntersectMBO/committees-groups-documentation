<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I’d love to join Cardano Civics Committee as a committee member.&#x20;

While I have abundant experience in protocol governance/ DAO governance and have been following the Cardano ecosystem, this is the first opportunity I will officially take. Thus, I’d love to start as a member and bring whatever I can to the committee.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

While I have not been directly involved with Intersect or Cardano, I have consistently followed and stayed informed about developments within the Cardano ecosystem. I'm particularly impressed with the progress of decentralizing the governance.

In other ecosystems, I have been heavily involved in protocol governance and the improvement of governance processes. I have been active in dYdX, Arbitrum, Optimism, Uniswap and Lido as an active delegate representing our network operation entity, Tané. In Optimism Collective, Tané is a member of the Optimism Grants Council and I'm the main representative of Tané. We have also received 1M OP token delegation from a16z and been a Top 20 delegate.

I believe that my experience and insights from these roles and experiences can be valuable to the Civics Committee, and I am eager to contribute to Cardano's governance through this position.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

As a plan, I will focus on optimizing the governance process to make Cardano governance more accessible and dynamic. Accessibility is one of the crucial keys to enhancing the dynamism and robustness of protocol governance from what I have seen in several protocols. I believe there is room to be improved within Cardano’s governance, which I can bring in my experience and knowledge gained through my past work in other protocols. I have established my core values as below for participating in the Committee.

1. Integrity I value integrity a lot. I believe integrity is the most important virtue even in the industry that values trustless and permissionless. In fact, even though I should aim for governance minimization in the end, the protocols should still need governance and it requires capable and sincere participants. I should be one of them.
2. Diversity Diversity is one of the most important values to achieve decentralization. I am very unique in various perspectives including the geographical diversity (Japan and Asia). I also value the diversities provided by other actors and am willing to appreciate them and collaborations with them.
3. Practicality I believe in the progressive decentralization. While considering the decentralization is the ultimate goal for crypto/blockchain projects to achieve, I sometimes value practicality and approaches that get things done rather than getting stuck in pursuing the “decentralization” too much from the start.
4. Transparency I believe transparency is a vital trait in decentralized systems. I communicate our findings, feedback, opinions, disagreements, and praises in a clear and constructive manner. I believe transparent communications should lead to better discussions and decisions to thrive.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

The community should vote for me because I bring unique perspectives gained from extensive governance experience with other notable protocols. While long-term contributors to Cardano offer immense value, I believe that insights from governance in different ecosystems can also significantly enhance our committee's effectiveness. My background allows me to contribute proven strategies and fresh ideas that can benefit Cardano's governance processes.

Additionally, I have roots in Japan, a region with a strong Cardano community but limited representation at the committee level. By bringing a Japanese perspective, I aim to bridge this gap and ensure that the voices of these communities are heard and considered in our decision-making.

Lastly, I have a proven track record. My selection as a member of the Grants Council in Optimism wasn't by chance it was the result of sustained efforts and recognition from others in the community. The values I've mentioned earlier are challenging to practice consistently, but I've demonstrated them across various protocols, earning respect and acknowledgment for my contributions.
