<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am not aware of the individual roles within the Budget Committee. However, based on my experience and insight I will and would be a welcomed addition to any role that requires planning, oversight or compliance of the budget. I have diverse experience managing teams and pulling segmented data together via analysis to make reasonable decisions. You will have Key performance indicators (KPIs) ready in order to see and judge progress based pn substantial data sets.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Attended the Cardano Constitutional workshop and consulting for a project that is a member of Intersect. Additionally, I have kept to date on the website and support the Five Pillars. I know Intersect is a key staple for the Cardano Ecosystem and benefit for the community and new projects. Nothing like this really exists for other blockchains. Intersect sets Cardano apart from the pack.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I plan and pledge to bring integrity, ethics and an openbook mindset. Items will and must be supported. No conflict of interest. Above all I intend to bring respect, professionally and personally treating those the same with 10 or 10 million ADA. I wish to maintain the core values of decentralization and maintain the Five Pillars of intersect.
