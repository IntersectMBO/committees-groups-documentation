<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in the Audit and Oversight role within the Budget Committee. My experience includes actively participating in the auditing of proposals within Project Catalyst, which has equipped me with a solid understanding of the importance of transparency and accountability in financial management. I believe that effective auditing ensures that resources are allocated appropriately and that the community can trust the financial processes in place. By focusing on these aspects, I aim to contribute to a more transparent budgeting process that fosters trust and collaboration within the Cardano ecosystem.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been an active member of Cardano since Fund6 of Project Catalyst in August 2021, consistently educating myself on Cardano’s core principles and sharing this knowledge within Latin America. I proposed a Fund7 mentorship and educational outreach initiative to onboard new members from Ecuador and Paraguay into the Cardano ecosystem. I also helped organize Cardano meet-ups in New York City with support from local Cardano ambassadors. Additionally, I was involved in creating a Cardano film during Fund8 to promote Cardano’s use cases and active projects within the Latin American community.

Currently, I am leading a Fund12 project aimed at educating new Cardano members in Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela with the support of local hubs. Since early 2024, I’ve become more involved in Intersect, contributing to the marketing working group, hosting a constitutional workshop in Bolivia, and assisting with one in Paraguay. I have participated in dRep pioneers workshops hosted by Hosky to explore Cardano governance, attended the Rare Evo budget workshop, and have been an active participant in Cardano Summits.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If elected, I pledge to establish a full-scale auditing working group or some form of oversight working group dedicated to ensuring transparency and accountability in the budgeting process. I plan to leverage blockchain technology to enhance transparency, making budget-related information easily accessible to all stakeholders.

Additionally, I will actively seek community participation in drafting budget proposals, fostering a collaborative environment where diverse voices can contribute to shaping our financial strategies.

I aim to create a standardized framework for submitting budget proposals from different working groups, such as the marketing working group. This framework will ensure consistency, clarity, and efficiency in the proposal process, enabling better evaluation and allocation of resources. By implementing these initiatives, I hope to strengthen the budgeting process and enhance the overall governance of the Cardano ecosystem.
