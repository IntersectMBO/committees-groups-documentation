If you are an associate and would like to partake in voting then you have until the **30th September** to upgrade your membership.

## Voting platform and methodology&#x20;

We will be using the [Summon platform](https://summonplatform.io/)&#x20;



We are planning on using the majority voting method, we are currently testing this. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a change from "ranked choice" voting which we were previously considering as majority voting is the simplest option and is still fair and transparent.
{% endhint %}

We will be using the "one-member, one vote" principle.  Each member (Individual and Enterprise) will have a vote for each committee.
