<summary>What do you think the MBO’s primary strategic goals and objectives are or should be for the next 3-5 years?</summary>

1. Increase the involvement of people of different cultures and language groups in the ecosystem

<details>

<summary>Can you describe the current composition of the Board and the skills and experience gaps that the organization is looking to fill?</summary>

We need leaders, experts who understand not only Cardano, but also the problems of the modern world.&#x20;

Those who are broad-minded and understand how a decision can affect members of society.&#x20;

Obviously, we need people who know how to manage, speak several languages ​​(including narrow languages), and have experience in building effective systems.&#x20;

I have experience in building systems and personnel management

<summary>What are the key challenges and opportunities the MBO is currently facing?</summary>

Challenges:

1. The people on the board spend too much time in Cardano. This can lead to confusion and misunderstanding of the situation. We need people with new experience and vision.
2. Cardano reputation outside the community is a little bit tricky.
3. Cardano needs mass-adoption and create easy educational tutorials
4. We need to create as many places as possible where people can pay ADA (lunch, haircuts, taxis, hotels). This will be an adequate adaptation&#x20;

Opportunities:

1. Create parallel economy
2. Create an image of an easy and understandable blockchain

<summary>How does the MBO measure success and performance, both at the Board level and operationally?</summary>

Productivity can be measured by the volume of quick, less bureaucratic decisions.&#x20;

If it becomes easier for people to understand what Cardano is, it will be a big step forward

</details>



<details>

<summary>What do you think is the relationship between the Board and the Executive team?</summary>

The Board makes decisions and is responsible for these decisions. The Board must clearly understand that any decision is a reflection of themselves.

The Executive team is an executive body that strictly implements the decision, but can exercise reasonable initiative

</details>



<details>

<summary>What are the key expectations for the Non-Executive Director (NED) role in terms of time commitment, specific responsibilities, and contributions to Board meetings and committees?</summary>

It must be a leader with a clear position, who puts people and their welfare first, and then himself.

He should guide and support, but not push

</details>



<details>

<summary>What/who do you think are the MBO’s key relationships with external stakeholders, and how does the Board engage with these stakeholders?</summary>

There should be a committee to communicate with stakeholders or the Board can appoint a person to build the correct communication.

</details>



<details>

<summary>What do you think is the MBO’s approach to risk management, and what are the top risks that the Board should be aware of?</summary>

I think, the MBO can allow itself 70% of stability and 30% of risk. Without a risk it's hard to achieve goals. But the level of the risk should be controlled and approved by the Board.

The Board should take a responsibility for the risky decisions.

</details>



<details>

<summary>How should the MBO support Board members in their roles, including providing information, training, and resources?</summary>

I believe that every Board member should undergo additional educational programs such as:

1. Risk management
2. Building highly efficient systems
3. Management Board members must be able to critically evaluate events, understand the pros and cons, and also be able to manage ongoing processes
