<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been actively engaged in the Cardano ecosystem since 2017, supporting its growth, governance, and decentralization principles. In 2024, I became an Intersect member and was chosen as one of the DRep training leaders, acknowledging my governance expertise and commitment to the Cardano vision. Currently, I sit on the Intersect Constitutional Council. My background in workforce planning and telecommunications has equipped me to understand strategic planning and operational efficiency. As the founder of HOSKY, a community-driven project, I am aligned with Intersect's values of empathy, transparency, trust, respect, teamwork, accountability, innovation, professionalism, diversity, and determination. I am committed to promoting the ecosystem’s growth and ensuring that Intersect’s role as a member-based organization becomes more transparent and impactful.

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

While my primary aim is to support the Cardano ecosystem and align with Intersect’s pillars and values, this affiliation may be perceived as a conflict of interest given HOSKY’s active presence in the Cardano community. Additionally, I collaborate with Cardano projects, and SPOs. My approach is grounded in transparency and fairness, ensuring that any decisions I make reflect the broader interests of Cardano and support Intersect’s mission to drive governance and continuity.

<summary>What do you think the MBO’s primary strategic goals and objectives are or should be for the next 3-5 years?</summary>

The MBO’s strategic goals must align with its five pillars: supporting the community's growth through developer-centric events, guiding governance and decision-making processes via CIP-1694, delivering the Cardano technical roadmap, ensuring stability within the ecosystem, and fostering open-source development. These objectives should be executed with an emphasis on Intersect’s core values of empathy, transparency, and inclusivity, ensuring that members can actively shape the direction of Cardano. Empowering the community, facilitating smooth governance transitions, and ensuring Cardano's resilience and technological advancement are key to the MBO's success.

<summary>Can you describe the current composition of the Board and the skills and experience gaps that the organization is looking to fill?</summary>

The current Governing Board comprises five seats, including representatives from seed funders Input Output Global and EMURGO, along with an interim COO seat offered to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Center of Excellence. The remaining two seats, to be filled through membership elections, should bring expertise in community engagement, decentralization principles, and technological insights. My goal is to help Intersect embody its values of transparency and empathy, making it accessible and recognized within the Cardano ecosystem. I bring a unique focus on connecting the community to Intersect’s objectives, establishing clear communication channels, and fostering shared accountability.

<summary>What are the key challenges and opportunities the MBO is currently facing?</summary>

The key challenge is to demystify Intersect’s role, bylaws, and processes to ensure transparency and drive engagement. As a member-based organization, there is a critical need to align its operations with the values of empathy, trust, and teamwork. By actively involving the community in decision-making and governance, the MBO has the opportunity to elevate Cardano’s ecosystem development and technical progress. Another challenge is coordinating the administration of the DevTrust to ensure Cardano’s continuity. Opportunities lie in leveraging Intersect’s values to drive innovation, enhance governance processes through CIP-1694, and ensure sustainable development in open-source technology.

Operationally, success is measured through key performance indicators like member engagement, delivery of governance processes, development events, and the successful orchestration of technical roadmap initiatives.

The relationship between the Board and the Executive team should be collaborative and built on trust.

They should work together to promote Cardano’s growth by fostering open-source development, supporting governance transitions, and ensuring community-led decision-making. Regular meetings, open communication, and a shared commitment to Cardano’s vision are crucial to this partnership.

As a NED, the expectation is to bring strategic insight and align with Intersect’s mission and values. This means being actively involved in monthly Board meetings, working on committees, and staying engaged with community initiatives. A typical time commitment could be a few hours each week, mostly spent preparing for discussions, participating in meetings, and collaborating on decisions. Responsibilities include supporting the governance process, guiding the administration of Cardano’s development funds, and making sure we're on track with Cardano’s goals and continuity.
