<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in a role within the budget committee. My academic background, including a master’s degree in finance, provides me with a strong foundation in financial management, resource allocation, and strategic planning. Coupled with my second master’s degree in computer applications, I bring a unique combination of financial expertise and technical understanding, allowing me to evaluate budget proposals from both economic and technological perspectives.

My experience reviewing Catalyst projects has further enhanced my ability to assess the financial viability of proposals and ensure that funds are allocated to projects that will drive meaningful impact within the Cardano ecosystem. As a long-term ADA holder since 2017 and an active member of WADA (West Africa Decentralised Alliance), I am also committed to ensuring that budget decisions support decentralization and promote inclusivity, particularly for underrepresented communities. A role within the budget committee would allow me to leverage both my academic background and hands-on experience, ensuring that Cardano’s financial resources are used efficiently and equitably.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a founding member of Intersect since July 2024 and have been deeply satisfied with the opportunity to help shape the Cardano architecture through this organization. I have been an ADA holder since 2017, purchasing my first tokens that I proudly continue to hold today. Additionally, I am an active member of WADA (West Africa Decentralised Alliance), where we focus on unlocking the potential of Africa and its diaspora through decentralized technologies.

Within the broader Cardano community, I actively contribute to the Catalyst project by reviewing proposals, moderating projects, and voting. This hands-on involvement across multiple facets of the ecosystem provides me with a well-rounded perspective on the challenges and opportunities within Cardano.
