<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

Of all the roles within the committee, providing education and community support excites me the most. I have a deep passion for both, and I would also love to host engaging events. That said, other aspects of the position also interest me, such as membership sales, account management, and handling grants, given my prior professional experience in these areas.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Since joining the Cardano community in 2021, I have gained a deep understanding of its core principles, which I fully support. In early 2024, I became more vocal on social media and more involved with Intersect, an organization I believe is essential to the success of Cardano’s on-chain governance. This is why I want to take on a more active role at Intersect, to help shape the future of Cardano in a meaningful way.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If elected, I pledge to uphold Intersect's values of empathy, transparency, trust, respect, teamwork, accountability, innovation, professionalism, diversity, and determination to the highest possible standard. I also aim to serve as a connecting force, encouraging participation in Intersect and advocating for increased education for everyone, all while maintaining the highest ethical standards.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

Since joining the Cardano community in 2021, I’ve developed a deep connection to its values—decentralization, security, inclusive accountability, self-sovereignty, peer-reviewed research, and high-assurance code. These principles are not just ideas to me

they represent a transformative vision for a more secure and equitable world. I am dedicated to advancing these values because I truly believe Cardano has the potential to create exponential, positive change. By voting for me in the upcoming Intersect elections, you're choosing someone who is fully committed to driving this vision forward with integrity and passion. Your support would mean everything to me as we work together to shape the future of Cardano.

In addition to being a paid individual member of Intersect, I am the founder of Cardano Curation, a digital marketing agency focused on Cardano. Since August 2024, I’ve also served as a Cardano Ambassador. I’m actively involved in the Cardano Paraguay community, which has organized two events in Asunción, including a constitutional workshop.
