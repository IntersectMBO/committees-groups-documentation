<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

Cardano has got to this point, on the cusp of decentralised governance, by balancing a conservative scientific approach with an adventurous entrepreneurial spirit.

If elected to the committee I will also balance these two qualities. I will take a conservative risk-reward approach to evaluating individual projects and an adventurous entrepreneurial strategy when announcing ourselves to the world.

When encouraging participation in this incredible experiment in self-governance Charles has emphasised that we will be in control of planning a strategy for our marketing and branding. I believe our greatest strength is our community, and no-one is smarter than everyone. I believe our treasury funds are better put to use supporting our community at the grass roots than being spent writing our name on things. So empowering our community, by simplifying and streamlining a grant process for small local events and hack-a-thons, and actively encouraging submissions from currently under-represented geographic regions. Including these in our strategy empowers our global community to experience the Voltaire era having a 3-dimensional impact on their world. No longer a concept on a screen, but seeing more and more opportunities to meet like-minded people, and have dynamic conversations about the future we are building together.

I believe in Cardano and the role we can play in this planets future.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I’ve launched and run several businesses in different industries, and have seen first hand the difference that community development and marketing makes between failure and success.

In my current work as a psychotherapist I listen to people to understand them and their ideas as clearly as possible. I always wish to hear the best explanation of an idea, strategy or project. Cardano is global, and it is exciting to imagine the diversity of ideas for marketing and branding that can be supported from Cardano's global following.  I have the experience and perspective to positively contribute to this stage of growing Cardano, with an adventurous entrepreneurial spirit when announcing ourselves to the world.
