I have some ideas like arrage some kind of hackaton but in a the whole world for young before they finish their studies. Something like math's olympics but for cardano's programming.&#x20;

Another idea is to search some companies ables to engage and create points club where we can change some products when the members reach n numers of actions. This is a pretty way to enhance fidelity.
