<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Kenric Nelson is President and Founder of Photrek, LLC which is an institutional member of Intersect. Photrek has completed pioneering research for Cardano on improving community decision-making. My accomplishments include running an ITN stakepool, successful execution of approximately a dozen Catalyst projects, serving on Catalyst Circle v2, publishing reviews of CIP-1694 governance, designing the Sociocratic Pluralism governance which seeks to establish high-quality processes for blockchain ecosystems, and contributing to the launch of the L∀LKUL DREP. On the Intersect Governance Working Group I have briefed the team on how consent decision making can improve outcomes in a manner similar to scientific peer review. For Catalyst, Photrek is currently a subcontractor to Input Output Global to evaluate the implementation and impact of using plural voting.

The Photrek team is committed to supporting the success of Intersect. To build an international team we have established Working Partner contracts that provide team members with the flexibility of an independent contractor and the commitment of portable benefits and indirect expenses to establish long-term coordination. Our Working Partners are serving Intersect in the roles of Board Observer (Juana Attieh), Civics Committee leadership (Jose Gambao, Eystein Hansen), and Members Committee Chair (Juana Attieh).
