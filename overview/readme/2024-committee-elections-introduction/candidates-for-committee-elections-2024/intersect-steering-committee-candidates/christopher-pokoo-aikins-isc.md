<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in a role within the Intersect Steering Committee, as it aligns with both my professional expertise and my passion for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem. With my master’s degree in finance, I have a strong foundation in resource allocation, strategic financial planning, and governance, which would allow me to contribute effectively to the committee’s overarching decision-making processes. As a long-term ADA holder since 2017, I am deeply committed to Cardano's success and believe that the Steering Committee plays a critical role in shaping its future. In addition to my financial background, my experience in project reviews, moderation, and voting within Catalyst gives me a well-rounded understanding of how funds are distributed to drive impactful projects.

By serving on the Steering Committee, I can help ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, transparently, and in a way that promotes both decentralization and inclusivity. I am particularly committed to advocating for underrepresented communities, leveraging my involvement with WADA (West Africa Decentralised Alliance) to ensure that voices from diverse regions are considered in key decisions. This role would allow me to contribute to the high-level governance and strategy of Cardano while applying my expertise in finance to foster equitable growth.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a founding member of Intersect since July 2024 and have been deeply satisfied with the opportunity to help shape the Cardano architecture through this organization. I have been an ADA holder since 2017, purchasing my first tokens that I proudly continue to hold today. Additionally, I am an active member of WADA (West Africa Decentralised Alliance), where we focus on unlocking the potential of Africa and its diaspora through decentralized technologies.

Within the broader Cardano community, I actively contribute to the Catalyst project by reviewing proposals, moderating projects, and voting. This hands-on involvement across multiple facets of the ecosystem provides me with a well-rounded perspective on the challenges and opportunities within Cardano.
