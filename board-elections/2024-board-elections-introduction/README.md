# 2024 Board elections Introduction

The board at Intersect has a fiducial and regulatory responsibility to the MBO.  They ensure Intersect complies with all relevant regulations, including those of Wyoming state regulators. As a member-based organization, the board primarily serves in the best interests of Intersect members, and as a result, our board is filled by Intersect members.

\
The board currently consists of five seats.  Two are held by Seed Funders, IOG and EMURGO.  The Wyoming State University holds the education seat, and we have two seats available for Intersect Membership.



We're looking for experienced and skilled members to apply and support Intersect into 2025 and beyond.
