<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a member of the Cardano ecosystem since 2018/19, though I have only recently stepped into a more active role in helping to promote fair and transparent governance both in theory and in practice.

I originally worked as the Cornucopias gaming-metaverse project’s lead copy-writer and content developer. During my time on the team, I served in various capacities including social media management, project management, creative strategy, community engagement and always as a liaison between the core team and our community of gamers, token holders, and NFT lovers.

During this time I learned to gauge community sentiment and derive practical steps forward to improve a variety of issues with the projects, while helping to ensure community representation in how the operating team responded to community feedback.

Until recently, I have served as the Social Media Manager for the Clarity Protocol and ADA Goats NFT project governance lead. In these capacities I have strengthened my community management and engagement skills, while developing a burning passion for decentralized governance, which compelled me to join Intersect and run for the Intersect Constitutional Council — upon which I currently sit as an alternate member.

I have been a member of Intersect since May, 2024 and currently have an Intersect Discord Level of 19, verging on 20 and currently hold these 6 roles:

1.) Verified&#x20;

2.) Tweeters&#x20;

3.) Governance Guardian&#x20;

4.) ICC Member&#x20;

5.) Intersect Constitutional Council Member&#x20;

6.) MKT WG

My point is that I’ve dedicated a large portion of my time trying to help the Cardano Community at Intersect, but I know I can do more for my community!

Additionally, I am hosting a Cardano Constitutional workshop in Austin, Texas — and to my knowledge, this is the only workshop that has decentralized the decision-making process via DAO-driven initiatives. Anyone in the Caradno ecosystem is invited to participate in helping our workshop make important choices, such as a venue selection, breakfast/lunch options, and the topics/questions under consideration for our workshop group.

My goal is to operate with transparency, gain the trust of the community I am trying to serve, and activate as many ADA-holders as I can so that we can have a robust, diversified, and truly decentralized blockchain ecosystem fully engrossed in the experiment of decentralized governance.

<details>

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

Here is my Intersect/Cardano rap sheet: I’m currently a sitting Alternate Member of the Intersect Constitutional Council, as well as a member of Intersect’s Marketing Working Group and Transparency in Governance Special Interest Group.

All of these are volunteer positions.

As previously mentioned, I work as an SMM for the Clarity Protocol and I am the governance lead for the ADA Goats NFT project. Though I will step away from these projects if elected to the Board of Directors at Intersect — go hard, or go home.

If a conflict of interest should emerge, it may only emerge as a result of a dispute between the Board of Directors and the Intersect Constitutional Council — as, if I am elected to serve the Cardano community at Intersect within this capacity, I will devote myself entirely to advancing the corporate interests and fecundity responsibilities of the MBO while doing my best to ensure that every action taken aligns with the Cardano Constitution.

I sit on the Intersect Constitutional Council as an alternate member without voting rights. I may only be called into action if and when a Full Member of the Council declares a conflict of interest. Otherwise, I do not anticipate any conflicts of interests, but will be happy to quickly and transparently declare them if/when they occur.

<details>

<summary>Are you currently in receipt of or previously received any Intersect or Cardano funding or grant?</summary>

Yes!

I am in the process of receiving a Cardano Constitutional Workshop grant totalling 25,000 ADA. Otherwise, I’ve kept my hand out of the Cardano-funding cookie-jar. I am here to help serve my community in any way I can — regardless of funding or grant opportunities. That being said…I am always happy to learn about either!

<summary>What do you think the MBO’s primary strategic goals and objectives are or should be for the next 3-5 years?</summary>

Intersect MBO’s most immediate and primary goal should be to avoid self-implosion during the early stages of its development.

This can follow as the consequence of a variety of things, such as not properly identifying, managing and mitigating potential risks to burning through Intersect’s contingency funds without establishing a source to generate revenue. So, my primary strategic goal/objective if elected to the Board of Directors would be to help the MBO find ways to extend its financial runway into Q1 2025 and beyond.

That beginning said, I think the most important strategic goals/objectives for the next 3-5 years should be focused on fulfilling the MBO’s supplier contracts on behalf of the Cardano DevTrust.

As per Intersect’s Membership Governance document, section G. “External Relationships,” number 3: “Intersect’s role is to actively engage in the negotiation process, ensuring that contractual terms align with DevTrust's objectives. Furthermore, Intersect will monitor the compliance and performance of suppliers, implementing necessary measures to uphold contractual obligations, optimize operational efficiency, and ensure community governance.”

I would also place a GREAT deal of focus on ensuring that these contracts are fulfilled on time and on budget. Additionally, the August 14th, 2024 Board Meeting notes state that 2024 key deliverables include:

1.) Supporting Cardano’s Governance&#x20;

2.) Establishing a Cardano Product function&#x20;

3.) Establishing a Cardan Annual Budget

To wit, the strategic goals for the next 3 - 5 years should help Intersect fulfill its purpose, as defined in the Intersect Membership Governance document:

“Intersect's purpose is to serve both as a professional network for Members and an open-source foundation to support the ongoing maintenance, development, and enhancement of Cardano. Intersect's purpose is to act as the administrator for the DevTrust and to support the growth of decentralized and inclusive systems on Cardano through technology education and the administration of Cardano’s governance processes, enabling technical changes and advocacy for Cardano.”

If elected to the Board of Directors, I will do everything in my power to ensure that Intersect stays on track and fulfills this stated purpose.

<summary>Can you describe the current composition of the Board and the skills and experience gaps that the organization is looking to fill?</summary>

From what I understand, the board currently consists of the following members:

Professor Steve Lupin with the University of Wyoming, identified as the “education” seat.

Nikhil Joshi, from Emurgo, identified as a “seed funder.”

Gerard Moroney, from IOG, also identified as “seed funder.”

Mercy Fordwoo, from Intersect, identified as a “member” seat.

Lawrence Clark of Intersect is the Board’s secretary.

Tim Harrison, Nigel Hemsley, and Kylie Schmeeckle have recently resigned from the board as per the Board’s July 5, 2024 meeting notes.

The skills and experience I would bring to the organization are simple, but could have a profound effect on operationality and efficiency of the Board: I’m a fresh face, and I’m not afraid to ask questions. I have Z-E-R-O corporate experience at this level, but I am earnest, able to adapt quickly to new circumstances, and ever-ready to think on my feet.

A fresh perspective can go a long way in helping the Board to make rational, thoughtful, and remunerative decisions. I work closely with a variety of leaders from the Cardano community at the grassroots level, and can serve as a liaison between the Board and the membership whose interests our decisions would affect.

My goal now, and if elected to this position, would be to help facilitate the exchange of information between all parties involved in Cardano’s governance infrastructure while learning as much as possible about how to simultaneously fulfill my duties as an Intersect Constitutional Council alternative and Board member. I see harmony here in pursuing the constitutionality of governance actions while working with the Board of Directors to ensure alignment with Cardano’s greater governance infrastructures.

This would also ensure that decisions being made in the boardroom align synchronously with the values of transparency and our ecosystem’s commitment to open-sourced methodologies.

I would like for Intersect to be the bastion of Cardano’s core values, and will strive tirelessly each day on various fronts to ensure it happens.

<summary>What are the key challenges and opportunities the MBO is currently facing?</summary>

The most immediate challenges the MBO must overcome are communications related. Cognitive overload is a massive problem facing our community at any given time — this is especially evident during the bootstrapping phases of minimum viable governance and as Intersect begins to develop and mature into a fully functional MBO.

I would like to source a variety of solutions from the community to help combat cognitive overload, and perhaps help the Board of Directors find a way to more effectively communicate important decisions and developments in a timely manner so as to gain the ecosystem’s trust.

Intersect has been slowly acquiring the Cardano community’s trust and acceptance, but it is far from a household name in the ecosystem. Increasing membership across all classes is crucial, and this can not be done if the ecosystem 1.) does not trust the organization, or worse yet, 2.) does not know the organization exists.

Additionally, due to the global nature of this endeavor, we have to consider how difficult it is for members to form cohesive and actionable units due to differences in language, culture, and timezones — all of which are communications challenges, and all of which need to be overcome in a manner that upholds fairness, accessibility, and transparency to every member of the community.

By finding solutions to our communications challenges, we will be better suited to operate as a decentralized net-work state that can then grow and evolve to overcome increasingly more difficult obstacles. As a member on the Board of Directors, I would like to focus on developing and implementing an ecosystem-wide information management and communications system that will help support our governance efforts well into the next decade.

<summary>How does the MBO measure success and performance, both at the Board level and operationally?</summary>

If elected, my initial goal will be to get my hands on the Intersect Business Plan I have read about on various documents scattered across the Intersect Knowledge Base. I know that there are a variety of OKRs that the Board needs to hit to deem our MBO successful or not, and I would like to start by understanding these metrics at mathematical level so I can help the Board measure and make decisions that will lead to success.

Additionally, there are a variety of governance-related metrics the Board should be cognizant of in order to measure the success of the blockchain’s decentralized initiatives, these include active voter participation rates, the development and delivery of a suite of governance tools that make participating in the ecosystem transparent and accessible to anyone, and a variety of other information management and communication systems that need to be employed in order to ensure an era of successful, community-lead governance.

Additionally, as per the Intersect Knowledge Base, “During Q1 of 2024 Intersect has more than seven major Continuity contracts to deliver over 30 new functionalities and features to the blockchain. Continuity only focusses and builds the base infrastructure, there are many more community projects, dApps and initiatives being built on top.”

A major operational success metric should be the completion and delivery of the Cardano Continuity Contracts, and an ecosystem-wide effort to identify, develop, and promote the various projects already built by the community that are currently providing value to the network — of which there are many.

I will do everything in my power to help oversee these efforts, and make myself available at all times to listen to the community’s ideas for improvement.

<summary>What do you think is the relationship between the Board and the Executive team?</summary>

The relationship between the Board and the Executive team is clearly outlined in Interserct’s Bylaws. As per Article 4, Section 1:

“1) Required Officers. The officers of the corporation shall be a President, a Secretary/Treasurer, and other such officers as may be elected in accordance with the provisions of this Article. The Board of Directors may elect or appoint other such officers as it shall deem desirable. Such officers shall have the authority to perform the duties prescribed by the Board of Directors. The same person may hold any two or more offices.”

Additionally, entry 4 further defines the role of the “President” as:

“5) President. The President shall be the executive officer of the Corporation and subject to direction from the Board of Directors. In the event that no executive officer is appointed, then the role shall be performed by a person nominated by the Board of Directors. He/she shall, in general, supervise and control all of the business and affairs of the corporation. He/she shall preside at all meetings of the members and of the Board of Directors. He/she may sign, with the Secretary or any other proper office of the corporation, contracts or other instruments which the Board of Directors has authorized to be executed, except in the cases where signing and execution thereof shall be expressly delegated by the Board of Directors or by these Bylaws or by statute to some other officer or agent of the corporation. In general, he/she shall perform all duties incident to the office of President as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors.”

If my reading of the Intersect Bylaws is correct, then it appears that the Board of Directors has the power to appoint executive team members, and as such, the relationship between the two indicates that the executive team is appointed and contributory to the Board of Directors.

<summary>What are the key expectations for the Non-Executive Director (NED) role in terms of time commitment, specific responsibilities, and contributions to Board meetings and committees?</summary>

Personal note on time commitment: I will put in whatever hours are necessary to help Intersect reach the next stage of its growth. As for the rest of this response: I am straight copy-pasting this answer and I am NOT ashamed to admit it. Time is of the essence my friends, and sometimes we need to make executive decisions like this one:

The role of a Non-Executive Director (NED) at Intersect (as a not-for-profit, member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming) includes the following key responsibilities and expectations:

1. Governance and Oversight

Strategy Development: Provide strategic guidance, ensuring that the organization’s goals and activities align with its mission and vision.

Performance Oversight: Monitor the performance of the executive team, offering oversight on key initiatives, finances, and risk management.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that the organization adheres to its legal obligations under Wyoming law, including compliance with nonprofit statutes, tax regulations, and reporting requirements.

2. Fiduciary Duties

Duty of Care: Act with reasonable care and diligence, staying informed about the organization’s activities and contributing to well-founded decisions.

Duty of Loyalty: Act in the best interest of the organization, avoid conflicts of interest, and disclose any potential conflicts.

Duty of Obedience: Ensure that the organization follows its bylaws, mission, and applicable laws and regulations.

3. Financial Oversight

Budget Approval and Monitoring: Oversee financial performance, approve budgets, and ensure that the organization operates within its financial means.

Risk Management: Ensure that appropriate financial controls, risk management processes, and insurance coverage are in place.

4. Support to the Executive Team

Mentorship and Guidance: Provide mentorship and strategic advice to the executive team without engaging in day-to-day management.

Succession Planning: Contribute to the planning and development of leadership succession, particularly for key executive roles.

5. Stakeholder Engagement

Member Representation: Ensure that the interests of the members are represented in decision-making and that communication between the board and members is open and transparent.

Public and Community Relations: Support the organization’s efforts in maintaining good relationships with its external stakeholders, including donors, partners, and the public.

6. Risk and Accountability

Personal Liability: While Wyoming law provides some protection, you may be held personally liable for breaches of fiduciary duty or if found negligent in fulfilling your duties. Ensure indemnification and Directors and Officers (D\&O) insurance is in place to mitigate personal risk.

Key Expectations:

Independence: Maintain independence in judgment and contribute unbiased opinions during board deliberations.

Engagement: Be actively involved in board meetings, strategic planning, and critical decision-making without interfering in the executive team's operational work.

Integrity: Uphold the ethical standards and mission of the organization in all board-related activities.

In summary, a NED in a Wyoming-incorporated not-for-profit is expected to provide governance, oversight, and strategic direction while ensuring compliance and ethical conduct, with an emphasis on supporting the executive team without becoming involved in day-to-day management.

<summary>What/who do you think are the MBO’s key relationships with external stakeholders, and how does the Board engage with these stakeholders?</summary>

I’m not entirely sure who the MBO’s external stakeholders are, if they are not the entities that provided seed funding, to include IOG and Emergo, as well as the founding / enterprise members of the organization.

I imagine that the DEVTRUST must also be an external stakeholder. In my mind, the Cardano community at Intersect should be the primary external stakeholders — but I am happy to be corrected in my thinking.

That being said, the Board has a duty to engage with the Intersect’s various stakeholders as “ambassadors for the organization in the community,” as per the Intersect Membership Governance document, Section 4, “Governing Board,” which states:

“Advocacy and Public Relations: Advocating for the organization's mission and promoting public awareness of its work. Board members often act as ambassadors for the organization in the community.”

The Board should provide regular updates, via blog, newsletter, video, or established social media communication channels to maintain and strengthen existing key relationships. This is where my background as a member of the Marketing Working Group may come in handy as there are already a variety of communications initiatives being discussed that could help the Board achieve these goals.

<summary>What do you think is the MBO’s approach to risk management, and what are the top risks that the Board should be aware of?</summary>

Intersect must adopt a holistic approach to risk management that takes into account every aspect of the ecosystem and the related risks and challenges that come with operating in a secure and decentralized manner.

Several risks are identified in Intersect’s Membership Governance document, section A Governing Board, number 6: Identifying and mitigating risks to the organization. These include financial, legal, and reputational risks, or any risks related to the delivery of services.

Additionally, there are a variety of digital security risks that must be considered by the Board’s risk management strategy, and should include implementing robust measures to protect user data, digital identities, and assets from online threats.

The network also runs the risk of concentrating too much power on centralized cloud servers, so initiatives to help disperse nodes and decentralize the network should also be taken into consideration.

Naturally, there are governance risks associated with what our enterprise is doing, so ways to mitigate bureaucratic bloat must be taken into serious consideration — which is actually a topic of conversation that comes up frequently among the Intersect Constitutional Council. How to avoid abuse of the system?

The Board should also be aware of the various smart contract and technical risks that face the blockchain on any given day, and should work closely with various appropriate committees to regularly audit codes to mitigate security risks, such as loopholes, bugs, and exploits.

Misuse of treasury funds could jeopardize the ecosystem’s health and make short work of the fledgling network state of Cardano. Implementing financial reporting mechanisms, multisig wallets, and ensuring that all guardrails within Cardano’s governance infrastructure are not only deployed, but ready to be put to use will help to mitigate this risk.

There are many risks coming at us from all sections of the galaxy. Thus the need for a comprehensive and holistic risk management strategy.

<details>

<summary>How should the MBO support Board members in their roles, including providing information, training, and resources?</summary>

Besides providing Board members with training and educational resources, the MBO should also facilitate regular out-reach programs between the Board and the broader Cardano community at Intersect. This will help to ensure that Board’s directives are aligned with the interests of the most important group of stakeholders Intersect has been established to represent: its members.

Board members should also be in close communication with the various committees at Intersect — as it appears that committees have been tasked with helping to fulfill the Cardano Continuity Contracts in one way or another. Perhaps establishing an inter-secretarial knowledge base of the committee’s latest updates would help to benefit both the Board and the greater Cardano Community at Intersect?
