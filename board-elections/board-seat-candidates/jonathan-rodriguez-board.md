<summary>Can you describe the current composition of the Board and the skills and experience gaps that the organization is looking to fill?</summary>

The Board consists primarily of representatives from the founding entities, bringing a wealth of knowledge in governance, strategy, and vision.

By joining the Board, I aim to bring an active community member's perspective, bridging the technical expertise of the current members with a deeper understanding of the grassroots initiatives driving innovation on Cardano. This will enable us to make more informed decisions, leveraging both the strategic and tactical insights necessary to propel Intersect forward.

<summary>What are the key challenges and opportunities the MBO is currently facing?</summary>

I believe MBO is facing two primary challenges that need to be addressed:

1. Low awareness: Despite its immense potential, MBO remains a relatively unknown entity within the Cardano community.
2. Limited Understanding of Purpose and Goals: As a result of this low awareness, many individuals within the community are unclear about MBO's importance, objectives, and vision. This lack of understanding hinders our ability to build support, an drive meaningful progress.

<summary>How does the MBO measure success and performance, both at the Board level and operationally?</summary>

Before measuring success and performance, it's essential to define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant goals for MBO, but here are my suggestions.

1. Governance Effectiveness: Assessing the effectiveness of our governance structure, including Board composition, meetings, and decision-making processes. (Target: 90% satisfaction rate from Board members and stakeholders). A Key indicators should be Regular surveys of Board members and stakeholders, attendance records for Board meetings
2. Initiative Launches: Tracking the number of new initiatives launched, as well as their impact and effectiveness in addressing pressing needs and priorities. (Target: 10-20 new initiatives per year)
3. Expense Management: Monitoring and controlling expenses related to operations, initiatives, and staff. (Target: 90% expense containment rate) A Key indicators should be Quarterly expense reports, budget vs. actual spend comparisons

<summary>What do you think is the relationship between the Board and the Executive team?</summary>

I believe the Board and Executive team should have a collaborative partnership, working together to set strategic direction, oversee governance, and drive organizational success. The board should provide oversight, guidance and accountability. The executive team should execute the strategy and manage operations to deliver results.

</details>



<details>

<summary>What are the key expectations for the Non-Executive Director (NED) role in terms of time commitment, specific responsibilities, and contributions to Board meetings and committees?</summary>

* Independent perspective on major decisions
* Active participation in discussions and decision-making processes
* Voting on major decisions and resolutions

</details>



<details>

<summary>What/who do you think are the MBO’s key relationships with external stakeholders, and how does the Board engage with these stakeholders?</summary>

MBO should have strategic partners who share its mission and values. These partners can help co-create solutions and amplify impact.

MBO should also listen to feedback, concerns, and suggestions from external stakeholders and incorporate them into its decision-making processes.

In addition, MBO should engage with foundations, government agencies, and other entities that offer funding for specific projects or initiatives.

</details>



<details>

<summary>What do you think is the MBO’s approach to risk management, and what are the top risks that the Board should be aware of?</summary>

Reputation Risk is a significant concern for the MBO, as it could result from poor governance, unethical behaviour, or failure to meet stakeholder expectations. This could lead to damage to the organization's reputation, loss of trust and confidence, and ultimately, financial instability.

Compliance Risk is another important consideration, as non-compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards could result in fines, penalties, or reputational damage. The Board should ensure that MBO has a robust compliance framework in place.

<details>

<summary>How should the MBO support Board members in their roles, including providing information, training, and resources?</summary>

I believe MBO should provide comprehensive support to its Board members to ensure they are equipped to fulfill their roles effectively

Offering training and development opportunities for Board members to enhance their skills, knowledge, and understanding of best practices in governance, risk management, and other areas relevant to their role.
