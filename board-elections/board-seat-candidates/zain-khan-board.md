<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

My journey with Cardano began in its early days, but it was during the Cardano Summit in Dubai last year that I truly immersed myself in the ecosystem.

Since then, my involvement has deepened through my selection to host the Constitutional Workshop in Dubai, marking a pivotal moment in my commitment to Cardano and its decentralised governance model. I am also active on the Cardano Forum and would love to continue my support to Cardano, irrespective of the decision to be selected as a board member or not.

As an advocate for both Cardano’s developments and Intersect’s mission, I’ve worked to expand the member base within local networks, fostering greater awareness and collaboration in MENA and the LATAM. My background in strategic communications and blockchain education has enabled me to effectively bridge technical concepts with real-world applications, driving meaningful conversations around Cardano’s future, and I am working with Cointelegraph to build relationships that can also be leveraged for Cardano blockchain! My renewal for Intersect is placed on 29th August 2025.

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

No, I do not have any other Cardano affiliations or conflicts of interest, whether as an individual or through any enterprise I am associated with ie. Cointelegraph.

I ensure that all my roles and activities are fully transparent and align with the goals of Cardano and the broader Web3 ecosystem.

I do not foresee any potential conflicts of interest, either now or in the future.

<summary>What do you think the MBO’s primary strategic goals and objectives are or should be for the next 3-5 years?</summary>



In my view, the MBO's strategic objectives for the next 3-5 years should focus on key areas that drive both growth and sustainability for Cardano. By aligning with these priorities, we can ensure the ecosystem remains robust, innovative, and inclusive while advancing Cardano’s mission globally.

The following goals and initiatives will be crucial to achieving this vision:

1. Global Expansion: Establish community hubs worldwide to foster innovation and Cardano’s reach. The world is divided into 5 parts, and we should include non-executive board members from various parts of the world to ensure we become the biggest ecosystem.
2. Innovation and Adoption: Support projects with real-world applications, driving blockchain adoption and tag along on existing narratives like DePin, and RWA to ensure we attract a broader community.
3. Education and Engagement: Instead of branching out into multiple Cardano courses, create a takeaway for the community that is educated on Cardano to support and receive incentives for their time and work to ensure long-term engagement.
4. Sustainability and Transparency: Ensure financial transparency and align goals with the broader blockchain industry.
5. Grant System: Raise awareness about Project Catalyst and all other available grants for users to be aligned to these available opportunities and build or market for the Cardano ecosystem.
6. Technical Infrastructure: Build public infrastructure to improve decentralization and DApp support, and ensure a seamless UI/UX experience!
7. Institutional Partnerships: Further collaborate with institutions to demonstrate blockchain technology and also incentivize the community to bring Cardano to the mainstream.

<summary>Can you describe the current composition of the Board and the skills and experience gaps that the organization is looking to fill?</summary>

The current Intersect Board consists of five seats, including representatives from Input Output Global (IOG), EMURGO, & the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Center of Excellence.

Two seats are reserved for Intersect members and are currently open for election with the expected results by the upcoming Cardano Summit in UAE.

While the board has strong expertise in governance, blockchain, and academia, there are key gaps in areas like financial oversight, decentralized governance, and community engagement.

The board would also benefit from experience in marketing, scaling global initiatives, and building partnerships with governments and institutions.

Once we manage to fill these gaps, it will help guide Intersect’s long-term growth and ensure broader global adoption of Cardano!

<summary>What do you think is the relationship between the Board and the Executive team?</summary>

The relationship between the Board and the Executive team is characterized by strategic collaboration and oversight, with distinct roles that complement each other:

1. Strategic Direction and Oversight: The Board sets the long-term vision, strategic goals, and governance policies for the organization. It ensures that the MBO aligns with its mission and values while holding the Executive team accountable for achieving these objectives.
2. Operational Execution: The Executive team is responsible for translating the Board's strategic plans into actionable initiatives and managing day-to-day operations. They report back to the Board on progress, challenges, and outcomes, ensuring that operational activities align with the strategic goals.
3. Collaborative Partnership: This relationship is built on trust, mutual respect, and open communication. The Board provides guidance and support to the Executive team, while the Executive team offers insights and updates to inform the Board’s decisions. Regular interactions and a clear division of responsibilities allow both parties to work together effectively to drive organizational success.&#x20;
4. Nevertheless, this is a symbiotic relationship that needs to be fostered for the long-term success of the Cardano blockchain!

<summary>What do you think is the MBO’s approach to risk management, and what are the top risks that the Board should be aware of?</summary>

From my limited understanding by broader experience, I have mentioned the top risks that the board must be aware of.

But first, the "Approach"

The MBO should implement a proactive risk management framework integrated into strategic planning, focusing on identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across various domains.

The Board oversees this framework, ensuring regular monitoring, contingency planning, and compliance audits, while engaging with stakeholders for early risk identification and transparency.

Now let's dig into the "Top Risks":

1. Regulatory Compliance Risk: Adhering to evolving laws is crucial for maintaining reputation and legitimacy.
2. Funding Risk: Continuous funding is essential failure to demonstrate value could jeopardize financial support.
3. Reputational Risk: Transparency and effective communication are vital to avoid damage to the MBO's reputation.
4. Operational Risk: Inefficiencies in management can lead to resource wastage and disengagement.
5. Decentralization and Security Risks: Reliance on a few node operators can threaten decentralisation broad deployment of nodes is necessary. Nobody likes a bad Nakamoto co-efficient in our space!
6. Community and Governance Risks: Low participation and misalignment with community interests can hinder governance.
