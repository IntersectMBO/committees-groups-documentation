<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I possess a profound and strategic understanding of Cardano’s objectives, having worked across all its key areas—technical, institutional, community, and political. I began studying Cardano in 2017 and, by 2018, was giving talks to private companies and NGOs. My technical contributions include creating the first physical Cardano node in Latin America, which ranked number 3 among over 3,000 pools globally, and hosting the first Cardano Hackathon in the region, which served as a precedent for similar global initiatives. I also founded ADA Labs for Blockchain Applications in collaboration with the National Technological University (UTN), ensuring that Cardano's technological advancements are integrated into academic institutions.&#x20;

On the community side, I have led the Latin American Cardano community and was elected by its members to represent them. I co-founded the Cardano Confederation, uniting over 15 SPOs and key communities across Latin America. This has provided me with deep insights into the needs and priorities of grassroots participants within the ecosystem.&#x20;

Institutionally, I have signed four contracts with the Cardano Foundation, three with IOG, and one with Intersect to host the first constitutional workshop. My collaboration extends to key figures like Aggelos Kiayias, Philip Wadler and Lars Brünjes among others, contributing to the academic foundation of Cardano. I understand the critical role of Cardano Foundation as the custodian of the brand and name, and I have actively contributed to its growth.&#x20;

On the political front, I successfully negotiated an agreement with the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), representing over 20 countries, to host the Cardano Summit 2024, where Charles Hoskinson will be a key participant. This partnership not only strengthens Cardano’s presence in Latin America but also illustrates my ability to navigate both the technical and political landscapes to further Cardano’s mission.

<summary>What do you think the MBO’s primary strategic goals and objectives are or should be for the next 3-5 years?</summary>

The top strategic priority for the MBO should be the implementation of real-world use cases for Cardano, such as the blockchain-based academic record system I am working on at the National Technological University (UTN) in Argentina. Starting with the educational sector offers a clear path to demonstrate Cardano's effectiveness before scaling to broader governmental services like digital identity management.&#x20;

Additionally, advancing technical infrastructure is critical. A key focus here is ensuring that Cardano can support DApp development efficiently. Cardano nodes alone are not enough a second layer of infrastructure is needed to index the ledger and provide fast, accessible data via APIs. While private solutions exist, I am working on the development of ALBA—a network of interconnected public institution nodes, which will provide both Cardano's layer 1 (relay) and layer 2 (API interface for DApps). This will offer developers a public, community-driven option to build without relying on private infrastructure, with the first node already installed at UTN and set to expand.&#x20;



Enhance Community Engagement:&#x20;

Empowering stakeholders by fostering a transparent and inclusive governance model is crucial for Cardano’s long-term success. A key initiative in this regard is the implementation of the Code of Ethics, launched by the Cardano Confederation, which replicates Norway’s ethical model. Just as Cardano has relied on the academic world to advance its scientific foundations, it is essential to adopt a similar approach for governance by embedding ethics into decision-making processes. Ethics, as a branch of philosophy, will guide Cardano’s governance model and ensure that integrity, fairness, and community-driven values remain at the core of all actions.&#x20;



Strengthen Institutional Relationships:&#x20;

Forging stronger partnerships with educational institutions, governments, and international organizations requires tangible, real-world demonstrations of blockchain technology. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through minimal hardware investment in these institutions. By installing physical nodes, we can show that Cardano’s blockchain consumes minimal energy, making it accessible and decentralized. This is particularly important given that around 90% of Cardano’s nodes are currently hosted by eight cloud providers, which does not represent true decentralization. Deploying physical nodes in public institutions will decentralize the network more effectively and make the technology more relatable to the broader public.

<summary>What do you think is the MBO’s approach to risk management, and what are the top risks that the Board should be aware of?</summary>

The MBO’s approach to risk management should focus on proactive identification, mitigation, and continuous monitoring of risks across both operational and strategic levels. The MBO must establish a comprehensive risk management framework that aligns with its decentralized governance model, while ensuring resilience in an evolving regulatory and technological landscape.

Key aspects of the MBO’s risk management approach include: Governance and Compliance Risks: Given Cardano’s decentralized nature, maintaining compliance with global regulatory frameworks is critical. The MBO must closely monitor developments in blockchain-related laws and regulations, particularly around issues like data privacy, financial oversight, and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Any changes in regulation could impact the network’s ability to operate across different jurisdictions.

Decentralization and Security Risks: While decentralization is a core strength, it also poses a risk if the network becomes reliant on a small number of node operators or cloud providers. The Board should focus on strengthening physical decentralization by encouraging the deployment of more public infrastructure nodes (as discussed with the ALBA network), ensuring that control does not become concentrated in a few entities.

Technological and Development Risks: As Cardano evolves, ensuring the reliability and scalability of the platform is critical. The Board should monitor risks related to software bugs, system vulnerabilities, or delays in key upgrades, which could disrupt the network’s performance and adoption. Proper auditing of code, along with stress-testing for scalability, will be vital to managing these risks.

Community and Governance Risks: Decentralized governance inherently comes with the risk of low participation or potential misalignment between community members and strategic goals. The MBO should focus on fostering a highly engaged and informed community that actively participates in governance, such as through voting on critical issues like CIP-1694. The lack of engagement could slow decision-making or lead to governance deadlocks. Financial Risks: Ensuring that the Cardano treasury is managed responsibly is another key area of risk. Mismanagement of funds or inefficient allocation toward unsustainable projects could deplete resources, hindering long-term growth. The MBO must ensure that financial resources are allocated strategically, with clear oversight mechanisms in place to prevent misallocation or misuse.

By addressing these risks through a structured, forward-looking approach, the MBO can maintain its strategic direction while safeguarding the Cardano ecosystem against potential disruptions.
