<details>

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

The key is to discuss a visionary roadmap that meets the requirements of a diverse ecosystem. This needs to be published and maintained over time. It should not be too detailed and promising, but also not too vague and general. I also see an essential task in the ongoing and open attitude towards dialogue and information flow on all sides. In general, everything should be handled as transparently as possible (with the exception of critical acute security risks)

<details>

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I have over 25 years of technical experience in IT services and have learnt many areas of the Cardano ecosystem over many years. I believe that I can contribute very well to prioritise the roadmap in the best possible way and influence technical decisions in a very broad context.
