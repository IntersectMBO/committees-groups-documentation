<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a member of the Cardano Community since 2019 during the ITN and HTN phases where I was a stake pool operator, eventually running an NFT/Token minting platform (Buffy Bot), and then moving into community event organization and planning (cNFTcon, NFTxLV). Through it all I have contributed to the open source and developer ecosystem of Cardano where, when, and how I could.

My goal, should I be elected to the TSC, is to do everything in my power to ensure that the Cardano technical development roadmap is truly aligned with community priorities and that we take every action to welcome and encourage new and emerging development houses the opportunity to contribute to network development.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I believe that to truly make Cardano a community-owned and operated ecosystem we must have community members who are willing to take up positions at every point and work to ensure decentralization and fairness of access with relation to funding and grants for development of the network and ecosystem.
