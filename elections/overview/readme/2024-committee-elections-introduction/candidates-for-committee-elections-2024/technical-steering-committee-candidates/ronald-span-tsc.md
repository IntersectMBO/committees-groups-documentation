Priorities for the Cardano roadmap should be a combination of what is requested by community projects and what is really required for businesses so they can use Cardano for certain business scenarios without having to worry about high costs. We like to make sure there is a good balance between both and that treasure funds are spend well so Cardano will be the go to blockchain for businesses and crypto users.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I represent Dquadrant, a team that has been successful delivering and executing projects over the last 4 years on Cardano. As a company we have invested a lot in Cardano, so it is in our importance that Cardano succeeds. I personally have 30 years experience in information technology and many years experience in executing projects successfully for clients, not only in the Web3 space. This experience together with our teams experience on Cardano could be beneficial to the TSC related to verify/or create project descriptions, prioritization of tasks, estimations of tasks, task assignment etc.
