The role I’m most interested in is overseeing the proposal process, ensuring that every proposal is treated with proper due diligence and care. I’m committed to making Cardano governance accessible, fair, and transparent for everyone. By ensuring the integrity of this process, we can empower more people to participate and strengthen the foundation of Cardano’s decentralized governance.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Since joining the Cardano community in 2021, I have gained a deep understanding of its core principles, which I fully support. In early 2024, I became more vocal on social media and more involved with Intersect, an organization I believe is essential to the success of Cardano’s on-chain governance. This is why I want to take on a more active role at Intersect, to help shape the future of Cardano in a meaningful way.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If elected to this role, I pledge to improve the process for submitting and funding proposals. I will advocate for standardized proposal submissions, clearer guidelines on bucket allocations, greater transparency in accounting from grantees, and the formalization of working groups. By addressing these areas, I aim to streamline the process and ensure that every proposal is handled fairly and efficiently, ultimately strengthening the governance and impact of Cardano.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

You should vote for me because I have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to making a positive impact within the Cardano ecosystem, and my track record reflects this dedication. I’ve actively participated in key governance events, including the Las Vegas Constitutional Workshop, and even hosted one in Asunción, Paraguay. As a project founder, I have always prioritized transparency and inclusivity, working with notable Cardano projects like USDM and REITCircles. In August 2024, I was honored to be named a Cardano Ambassador, a role I take very seriously. My experience, dedication, and passion make me a strong advocate for the community, and I would be honored to have your support.

In addition to being a paid individual member of Intersect, I am the founder of Cardano Curation, a digital marketing agency focused on Cardano. Since August 2024, I’ve also served as a Cardano Ambassador. I’m actively involved in the Cardano Paraguay community, which has organized two events in Asunción, including a constitutional workshop.

Cardano Curation, the project I founded, is currently under contract with Intersect through a grant to produce and post 10 videos about Cardano, its decentralized governance structure, and Intersect. I have also applied for funding to start and maintain a community hub in Asunción, Paraguay.
