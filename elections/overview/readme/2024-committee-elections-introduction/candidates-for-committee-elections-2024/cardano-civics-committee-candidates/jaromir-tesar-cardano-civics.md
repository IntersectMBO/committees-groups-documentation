<details>

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a Cardano ambassador for about five years, primarily as a content creator. I also serve as a Catalyst community reviewer and had the opportunity to be one of the DRep training leaders. I maintain the local Cardano community, and we occasionally hold meetups with my colleaguesâ€”the next one is scheduled for October 2024. I have registered as a DRep a few weeks ago.

<details>

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

While voting on governance actions will occur on-chain, debates will take place off-chain. The Commission must monitor the locations and methods of these debates and provide or develop a suitable platform where all data is accessible. Ideally, this platform would allow registered DReps to debate among themselves.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I believe I am a well-known figure in the Cardano community, dedicated to decentralization and governance. I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue this effort.
