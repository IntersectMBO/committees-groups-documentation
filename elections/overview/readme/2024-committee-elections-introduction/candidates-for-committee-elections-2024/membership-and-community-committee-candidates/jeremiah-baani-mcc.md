<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Jeremiah Baani is a Cardano Ambassador and a leading Cardano blockchain educator in Ghana with an extensive community in Ghana and other parts of Africa. I am also the founder of the “Cardano Africa Academy” whose main mission is to “make cardano a household name in Africa through education and training”. As a blockchain educator and meetup organizer, I have successfully hosted multiple Cardano meetups in Ghana and other parts of Africa. I played a key role in the launch and establishment of the Kenya Cardano community.

Furthermore, I co-hosted the Intersect Regional Hub launch in Northern Ghana, alongside the main event in Accra. Additionally, I coordinated the hosting of the Intersect Regional Hub launch in Nairobi, Kenya, which was a significant success. I was part of the team that coordinated and facilitated the Intersect Constitutional workshops in both Kenya and Ghana. Previously, I organized and hosted the CIP-1694 workshop in Northern Ghana (Nalerigu).

Moreover, I have educated nearly 1,000 young people across Africa both in-person and online about the Cardano ecosystem and the opportunities it offers with support from the Cardano Foundation and partnerships with wada to mention but a few. You can check out a few of my impactful works on my youtube channel and X respectfully (https://www.youtube.com/@cardanoafricaacademy, X: @jerrybnj).

With my proven leadership as a Cardano Ambassador and community events organizer across Ghana and other parts of Africa, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to foster collaboration and drive impactful initiatives in IntersectMBO and the wider cardano ecosystem. My experience in hosting major events like the Intersect Regional Hub launches and facilitating governace workshops highlights my commitment to Cardano’s growth and governance. Additionally, my efforts in cardano-intersect education among the youth about the ecosystem underline my dedication to community empowerment. As a committee member, I would leverage these experiences to further strengthen and expand the Cardano community across Africa.
