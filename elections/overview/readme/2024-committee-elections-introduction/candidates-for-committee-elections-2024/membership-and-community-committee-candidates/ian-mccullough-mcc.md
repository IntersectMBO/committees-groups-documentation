<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

My company Awen has recently signed on with Intersect as The North American Community Hub and is tasked with producing the 2024 North American Hub AMM.

I also hosted the Constitutional Workshop in Chicago and supported/attended the DRep Workshop for Chicagoland. I was elected by my peers as traveling alternate from the Chicago Constitutional Workshop to participate in the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires.

Awen received Catalyst Fund10 Grants to successfully produce events at both the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, WI and 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, IL, getting global press from MarketWatch, BBC, WSJ, Reuters, USA Today, Bloomberg, and Bitcoin Magazine.

Awen is actively developing creator applications using community and open-source tools like NMKR, CardanoPress, and Blockfrost to make marketplaces for permissionless p2p music synchronization licensing for metaverse and video games.

I have performed music and/or spoken at Rarebloom, cNFTCon, and RareEvo 2023 and RareEvo 2024.

I have won #1 and #3 place in NuCast x Project NEWM Music Video Contest.
