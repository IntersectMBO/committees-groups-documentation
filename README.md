As a member-based organization transparency and accountability are core values to how Intersect best serves the Cardano ecosystem. Elections are a core component of transparent representation, continuing to be a member-driven organization. Intersect was established in Wyoming at the end of 2023, and since then has been steered by members who raised their hands and got involved. Thank you to all those who stepped up as Founding Members and moved us forward during our first year.

## Moving to elected positions

All committees have been gearing up to be elected groups, filled by members directly. In September and October, we're excited to open elections for members to apply and join our core committees! In addition, our governing board will be seeking two members to join as non-executive directors - guiding and supporting the organization from a legal and operational perspective.

## Key information for our members

* September 9th, we will be accepting applications to join committees and the governing board. Applications will close September 27th
* October 4th, voting will open and all eligible\* members will be able to select and vote for their preferred candidates on both committees and the governing board. Voting will happen through the online members area and close on October 20th.

\*Members of Intersect are those who have joined or renewed their membership for $10 as an individual or $1,000 as an enterprise. "Associates" are not eligible to stand. You must be a member on or by 27th September.
