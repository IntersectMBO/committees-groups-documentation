## Time&#x20;

Each committee is different in nature and how they execute their duties. &#x20;

Committee members are spending approximately twenty (20) hours per month on committee activities (meetings and other committee initiatives) and committee chairs approximately forty (40) hours per month. &#x20;

## Participation

To ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate we are requesting that members only apply to be elected to a maximum of two (2) committees.

## Role Term

For the initial election we are proposing a term of one (1) year.  We may consider extending this to two (2) years for elections from October 2025 onwards to prevent election fatigue and allow committee members sufficient time to deliver their plans. &#x20;

We will engage with the community on this next year.
