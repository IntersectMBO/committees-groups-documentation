<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

Budgets are always subject to scrutiny and more often than not contain words like contingency funds!! This area is often open to misuse and is a sign that the budgets are not properly thought through. In order to protect the treasury, we need to be certain that budgets are properly created and thought out, and leave little room for manipulation or abuse.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been active in the Cardano space since 2020 as an observer, as well as incorporating the technology into a real world project I am developing. I have extensive insight to communities and their growth. In 2022 I opted to mint a token for use in our project development. My project is around renewable energy, and the potential to create Carbon Credits relying on data from the blockchain and our technology. I have hosted a Cardano constitutional workshop in September 2024 in Mauritius, with Intersect MBO. I have a broad understanding of the Governance aspects along with the underlying philosophy of Cardano as a chain. I am not an investor and am therefore detached from the market and volatility - this is crucial in guiding thoughts and decisions that are in the best interest of the community.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

With a great insight gleaned from a constitutional workshop, there are ways in which to ensure there are proper and defined budgets in place. There needs to be complete transparency and proper explanation for the community to truly understand the budgets. There should be a clearly defined list of expenditures, and well as auditable milestones to ensure budgets are spent wisely. I will apply all my business knowledge and writing budgets to ensure what the community see's is clear and deliverable.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I have no attachment to Cardano - I have a commitment to ensuring transparency and realistic objectives being delivered. Budgets are complex, I intend to make them simple and more efficient in order to make things simpler.
