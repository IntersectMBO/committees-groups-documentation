<details>

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a member of the Cardano Community since 2019 during the ITN and HTN phases where I was a stake pool operator, eventually running an NFT/Token minting platform (Buffy Bot), and then moving into community event organization and planning (cNFTcon, NFTxLV). Through it all I have contributed to the open source and developer ecosystem of Cardano where, when, and how I could.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I would like to continue to drive the Cardano Open Source ecosystem to see wider and easier community participation in core maintenance and development metrics.

<details>

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I am one of the few individuals with previous experience being part of the committee and have a long history of developing open source tools in the Cardano ecosystem. I believe that my knowledge and contributions as a community member can help to open avenues for contribution and participation from the wider ecosystem beyond the "founding entities" to ensure a healthy and robust open source ecosystem exists around Cardano and specifically related to the Intersect-managed repositories and technologies.
