\[An

Yes, I am particularly interested in taking on the role of "Global-Local Liaison Officer" within the Cardano Civics Committee. This role would involve:

1. Facilitating communication between local communities (especially in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region) and the global Cardano ecosystem.
2. Ensuring that diverse perspectives are integrated into governance discussions and decisions.
3. Developing and implementing strategies to increase local community engagement in global governance processes. I am interested in this role for several reasons:
4. Unique Position: As a core member of the Intersect Japan Hub and an active participant in global Cardano events, I am well-positioned to bridge the gap between local and global perspectives.
5. Experience in Governance: My involvement in the CIP-1694 Workshop, DRep Workshop, and selection for the Interim Constitution Committee has given me a deep understanding of Cardano's governance mechanisms and challenges.
6. Community Building: My experience organizing local meetups (like the Okinawa meetup) and participating in global summits has honed my skills in community engagement across different cultural contexts.
7. Technical Knowledge: As an SPO, I can help translate technical governance proposals into language that is accessible to local communities, ensuring broader participation.
8. Cultural Mediation: My ability to understand and communicate effectively across Japanese and global contexts can help ensure that cultural nuances are not lost in governance discussions. By taking on this role, I believe I can contribute significantly to making Cardano governance more inclusive and globally representative, while ensuring that the unique perspectives and strengths of local communities, particularly from Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, are fully leveraged in shaping Cardano's future.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

In 2021, deeply impressed by Cardano's innovative philosophy and technology, I began contributing to this ecosystem. Since then, I have gained experience in various fields, including community revitalization, acquiring a global perspective, technical contributions, and participation in governance. Within Japan, I have actively participated in and supported the operation of various workshops and meetups. Through these activities, I have contributed to building and expanding the foundation of the Cardano community.&#x20;

In 2023, I participated in the CIP-1694 Tokyo Workshop, contributing to discussions on Cardano's next-generation governance model.&#x20;

In October 2023, I attended the Cardano Summit in Dubai to broaden my global perspective. There, I engaged in deep discussions with Cardano experts and enthusiastic supporters from around the world, building a global perspective and network. This experience reinforced my recognition of the diversity and potential of the Cardano ecosystem, while also making me acutely aware of the importance of bringing the voice of the Japanese community to the international stage. It provided a valuable opportunity to directly understand the trends and challenges of the international Cardano community.&#x20;

On May 1, 2024, as a technical contribution, I launched the stake pool operator (SPO) contributing to the decentralization of the network. In June 2024, I organized and hosted the Okinawa meetup, focusing on developing the Cardano community in regional areas.&#x20;

August 2024 was a crucial month for Cardano governance activities. I hosted the DRep Workshop in Tokyo, promoting understanding of the delegate representative system and encouraging participation from the Japanese community. Subsequently, I organized the Constitution Workshop in Osaka, where I was elected as the Osaka representative. This led to my selection to participate in the Interim Constitution Committee to be held in Argentina in December 2024, providing an opportunity for direct involvement in global Cardano governance. Through these activities, I have taken on the important role of bringing the voice of the Japanese community to the global stage and reflecting Japanese perspectives in international governance discussions.&#x20;

Currently, I am serving as a core member of the Intersect Japan Hub council, dedicated to promoting and developing Cardano in Japan. Through this role, I am working to bridge the Japanese Cardano community with the global ecosystem.&#x20;

These diverse experiences have deepened my understanding not only of the technical aspects of Cardano but also of the importance of community, the necessity of bridging global and local perspectives, and the practical aspects of governance. In particular, the decision to participate in the Interim Constitution Committee represents an opportunity for direct contribution to global Cardano governance, which I am confident will greatly benefit my activities as a member of the Cardano Civics Committee.
