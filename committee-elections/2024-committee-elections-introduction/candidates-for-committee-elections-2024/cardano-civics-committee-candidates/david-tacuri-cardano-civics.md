<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in the role of updating guidelines, templates, and standards for on-chain voting, as well as providing non-binding recommendations to the community regarding improvements to Cardano governance. I believe that clear and well-defined guidelines are essential for ensuring that the on-chain voting process is efficient, transparent, and user-friendly. By refining these standards, I aim to enhance community engagement and participation in governance decisions.&#x20;

Additionally, offering non-binding recommendations allows for a collaborative approach, where community feedback can inform and improve governance processes. I am committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all community members feel empowered to contribute to the ongoing development and enhancement of Cardano's governance framework.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have extensive experience within the Cardano ecosystem, particularly in the areas of education and technical development. Over the past few years, I’ve organized more than 10 workshops in schools and universities across Ecuador and Paraguay, where I’ve been teaching people about blockchain technology and how Cardano operates. I also had the opportunity to actively participate in two constitutional workshops, one in Paraguay and another in Bolivia, where I contributed to the discussions on creating a minimum viable constitution for Cardano.

Additionally, I was part of the Ayllu decentralized education platform, which aims to educate people about Cardano. On the technical side, I have experience in setting up Cardano nodes and am currently enhancing my skills by learning Aiken, a programming language for Cardano.

I’m involved in two major initiatives through Project Catalyst: the Fund11 "Blockchain Voting System" and the Fund12 "Digital Voter ID using Atala Prism."

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If elected, I pledge to work towards an improved voting system that enhances transparency, accessibility, and user-friendliness for all community members. My focus will be on refining the guidelines and templates for on-chain voting to ensure clarity and consistency in the process.

In addition, I will actively seek to implement strategies that foster more inclusive governance within the Cardano ecosystem. This includes creating outreach initiatives to educate and engage underrepresented community members, ensuring that diverse voices are heard and considered in governance decisions. I will advocate for feedback mechanisms that allow community members to share their insights and suggestions, facilitating a collaborative approach to governance that reflects the values and needs of the entire Cardano community.

To further enhance governance, I propose the establishment of a community feedback platform that enables ongoing discussions about governance topics. This platform would allow members to express their opinions, propose ideas, and vote on governance issues in a more iterative and participatory manner. Additionally, I will advocate for regular town hall meetings where community members can interact directly with committee members to discuss governance updates and express their concerns or suggestions.

Furthermore, I aim to explore the possibility of developing a mentorship program within the governance framework, pairing experienced members with newcomers. This initiative would not only facilitate knowledge sharing but also help to create a more engaged and informed community.

Lastly, I will push for increased transparency around governance decisions and their impacts, ensuring that the community is well-informed about the rationale behind key choices. This includes creating regular reports on governance activities and outcomes, accessible to all members. By prioritizing inclusivity, transparency, and active participation, I aim to strengthen our governance framework and enhance community trust and involvement.
