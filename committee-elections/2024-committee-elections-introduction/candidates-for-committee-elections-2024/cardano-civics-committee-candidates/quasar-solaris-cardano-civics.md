I am an Individual founding member of intersect and participate in the Governance Transparency Special Interest Group of IntersectMBO. I have been building my experience with cardano since September 2020 when the community united to create a roadmap for the Cardano Foundation which was without a CEO at the time. During this experience, Project Catalyst began and I became heavily engaged with decentralized governance and innovative funding mechanisms.
