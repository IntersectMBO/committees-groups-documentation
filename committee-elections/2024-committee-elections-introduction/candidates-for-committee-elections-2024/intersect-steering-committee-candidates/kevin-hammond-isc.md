<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I co-chair the Intersect Parameter Sub-Committee, and serve on the Intersect Technical Steering Committee, Security Working Group, and Hard Fork Working Group. I interact regularly with Intersect employees and members as part of my role as Head of Engineering for Cardano at IOG. I have helped establish Intersect as a functioning entity. In addition to my institutional membership via IOG, I am fully committed to Intersect as a personal founding member.

Today, Cardano is an established and respected blockchain, offering advanced proof-of-stake capabilities, staking rewards for Ada holders, smart contract capabilities, while operating a highly reliable globally distributed and decentralised network. Importantly, it also has a highly advanced and decentralised community governance system. As Head of Software Engineering for Cardano at IOG, and now IOE, I have been at the heart of this development, from the rollout of the Incentivised Testnet in 2019 to the delivery of the Chang Hard Fork earlier this month, and for the forthcoming Chang+1 delivery that will complete CIP-1694 and enable on-chain decentralised representation.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I pledge to use my detailed technical knowledge of Cardano, my long-standing research background, my strong software development background, and my connections with the Cardano ecosystem, to ensure that the best possible outcomes are achieved for Cardano, so that it maintains its unique position and influence within the blockchain sphere. I pledge to fulfil my duties to the community in an honest and transparent way, as a representative member of the Steering Committee.

Technology is at the heart of Cardano. I am applying to the Intersect Steering Committee since it is important to have a strong technical voice and presence on this key committee, that will shape the future direction of Intersect and its role within the community. My intention is to ensure that technology and research remain at the heart of Cardano, and that Intersect acts as the glue between Cardano developers and users. Many challenges need to be overcome, including setting the right long-term directions for Cardano as a reflection of a diverse and multi-faceted community. I will strive to achieve the correct balance, for the greater good of the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

As Head of Engineering for Cardano at IOG, I have been heavily involved in Cardano on a daily basis since 2019. I was a founding author of CIP-1694 and am firmly committed to the principles and practice of open community governance. I have provided Intersect with knowledge and advice that has enabled it to become established. I will continue to do this so it achieves the success that is needed to maintain Cardano as a leading blockchain.
