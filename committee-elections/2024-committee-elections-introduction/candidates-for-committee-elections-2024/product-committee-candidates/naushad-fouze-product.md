<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am interested in running for a seat on the Product Committee, because I believe in Cardano's vision. The product committee's role I believe in shaping Cardano's future is critical, and I want to draw from my journey and contribute my expertise to this process. My goal is to help guide Cardano's evolution, ensuring we stay true to our founding principles while driving adoption and innovation.

I aim to bring transparency to our decision-making, amplify diverse community voices, and focus on long-term network health. With my background in software development and experience working with diverse teams, I want to help bridge technical possibilities with strategic vision. This seat represents an opportunity to protect and grow the network I've come to deeply believe in over the past seven years.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Having been here since Cardano's public inception in 2017, my first technical contributions to the Cardano ecosystem was when I set up one of the earliest staking pools on the incentivized test network(ITN)\[WIRA] and was one of the earliest to set up and run 10 concurrent staking pools (WIRA0 - 10) on the Cardano network.

I have since helped co-found CoinCeylon Sri Lanka and currently act as the CTO for CoinCeylon. Through CoinCeylon me and my team has launched the first Cardano stake pool in Sri Lanka, the first CNFT project (Yakka) in Sri Lanka, which was developed completely in-house (nft minter, art and marketing), and has hosted and continue to host multiple events in Sri Lanka educating about and promoting Cardano and Intersect locally.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I believe we are witnessing a significant milestone in the evolution of blockchain technology. For the past 7 years I watched, participated and built on Cardano because I believe in Cardano's promise to focus on building things right, building things that follow a philosophy that choose to serve as much of humanity as possible and being careful and responsible about what is being built.

Cardano has built a best in class network that I believe deserves and needs to be adopted globally.

I believe you should vote for me, because I too believe in these principles Cardano was founded on and still run on. I believe the product committee holds a very important role in defining where this ecosystem will be in the future, and therefore I believe it needs to be done properly and carefully.

I have been a developer for over 20 years and have worked with a vastly different range of technologies over the years. I have build several technology companies, trained developers and helped both architecture and develop software throughout my career. I have also had the privilege of living, working and building in different countries around the world, that has helped me work together with people from all types of backgrounds. I want to do my best to help grow and protect this network I have come to love so much.
