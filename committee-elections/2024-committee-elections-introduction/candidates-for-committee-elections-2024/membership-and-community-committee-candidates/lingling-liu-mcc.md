<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in the role of sports chair within the committee. With over 30 years of proven experience in the sports industry, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of sports. Like many other sectors, the sports industry is at a pivotal point where change is essential. Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world." I firmly believe in this vision. My goal is to focus on the sports community, leveraging my extensive background to drive innovation and technological advancements. By embracing new technologies and innovative approaches, we can enhance the impact of sports on society, fostering inclusivity, health, and community spirit, thus helping Cardano with mass adoption.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I came across the Cardano blockchain in early 2021 and have been an active advocate of Cardano ever since. I have worked as a consultant for NMKR.io as Head of Sports Partnership since January 2023 and I am also the Chinese translator for John Greene's book Cardano for the Masses, which will be published next year. I came across Intersect because of the Cardano Consitutitional Workshop and recently have been to the one in London, and it was fantastic experience.
