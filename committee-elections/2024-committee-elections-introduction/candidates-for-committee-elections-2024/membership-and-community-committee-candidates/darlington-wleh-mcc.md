<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a founding member since the initial January launch. I also contributed to the 1694 process by hosting twitter space on the cip and encouraging community feedback and engagement. I held a 1694 workshop as well as attended the in person initial IOG held workshop.

Lido Nation has been a core pillar of Catalyst governance infrastructure by providing a unraveled transparency to the catalyst process via our catalyst explorer tool.

Lido Nation was also recently awarded an intersect grant to deliver the DRep Campaign Platform currently hosted at 1694.io.

I pledge to continue doing what we've been doing at Lidonation:

* Listen to the community to align our efforts with their biggest pinpoints&#x20;
* working to increase the level of saturation of educated blockchain users in low adoption areas.&#x20;
* Focusing on improving community tooling to make cardano processes transparent and accessible.
