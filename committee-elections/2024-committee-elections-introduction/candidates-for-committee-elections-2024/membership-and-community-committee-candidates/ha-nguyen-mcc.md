I can support organizing events, forums, and online platforms, creating spaces for interaction and knowledge sharing among community members.

Reason:

Because I have experience in organizing Intersect events and Cardano Meetups. In particular, I have a strong influence within the community, especially in Vietnam and Japan. This facilitates interaction, knowledge sharing, and collecting feedback from the community.

1. Experience and Contributions to Intersect

Over the past period, I have actively participated in and organized various events sponsored by the Intersect community, such as:

Intersect Meetup: This is a networking event that brings together members to strengthen relationships and promote knowledge exchange within the community.

Constitutional Workshop: I organized workshops to share and discuss issues related to the Constitution of the Intersect ecosystem.

DRep Cardano Training - DRep Pioneer Leader: I conducted training sessions and guided members on the role of DRep, helping them better understand the position and importance of being a Voting Representative within the ecosystem.

And I am also a member of the Japan Intersect Hub.

2. Contributions to the Cardano Ecosystem As a Cardano Ambassador, I have organized numerous Cardano Meetups and programs aimed at community development. I am also a member of the Constitutional Committee under the Eastern Cardano Council and have been elected by the community as a Voting Delegate. During my participation in Project Catalyst, I have taken on multiple roles such as Proposer, Community Reviewer (CR), and Milestone Reviewer, contributing to the support and evaluation of proposals within Catalyst. Notably, I have been nominated as one of the Top 5 Most Active Cardano Ambassadors in 2024, and I am currently in the final round of community voting.
