<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I am the Founder and Director of the Cardano Ghana Community and a Cardano Ambassador, dedicated to advancing blockchain education, youth empowerment, and community-driven projects. Since 2021, I have organized and facilitated several community-led events, including the Cardano Summit 2021, 2022, and 2023, which collectively engaged over 500 participants. Through my work, I have onboarded more than 100 individuals to Project Catalyst and educated hundreds more on the opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem.

As a proud individual founding member of Intersect, I have been closely involved in governance activities, including launching the CIP 1694 Governance Working Groups in Tamale. This initiative allowed community members to explore Cardano's governance framework during the Voltaire era, with a focus on decentralized decision-making and governance participation. My role within Cardano Ghana extends to educating and guiding newcomers through governance mechanisms, fostering a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and its potential to drive socio-economic change in Ghana.
