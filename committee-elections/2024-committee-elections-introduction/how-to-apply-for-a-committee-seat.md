**27 September** - Application Process Closes



## Eligibility

Only Individual and Enterprise members or employees of our seed founding organisations **are** eligible to apply for a seat on a committee as stated in the member benefits.  \
\
Associates **are not** eligible to apply as they do not hold this benefit, all applicant will be verified to confirm they hold the correct level of membership. &#x20;

If an associate applies they will receive an email asking them to upgrade to paid membership.  If they do not upgrade to paid membership by the application closing date on the **27th September** then their application will be withdrawn.  &#x20;

## Process

There will be a form which will be accessible through the member portal.

The form will contain a number of questions for each applicant to answer as noted below.  The questions annotated with a (P) will form part of the biography which will be made public to the membership when the delegates are announced at the beginning of October.



## Seed Funding Organisation Employees (EMURGO & IOG)

We have established a bespoke process for our seed funding organisation employees.\
In the first instance please seek approval from your home organisation to apply.  Then join Intersect as an associate using your home organisation email.  When the application process opens you will be able to apply for a committee through your member portal.  Please note if you receive a "please join as an individual member" email you can disregard this and your application will still be processed.  We are currently trying to ensure this email is not triggered.\


Please ensure you use your home organisation (EMURGO or IOG) email as this will be how we verify you are part of a seed funding organisation.  Please also note that you are part of a seed funding organisation in the affiliation section of the application.
