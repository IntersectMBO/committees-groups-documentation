<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

With over 25 years of experience in project management, community engagement, and healthcare across West Africa, the UK, and Canada, I bring strong skills in connecting diverse communities and managing complex projects. As co-founder and Partnerships Lead at Wada Global -an Intersect Enterprise member and Regional Hubs Facilitator for Africa-, I have been deeply involved in growing the Cardano ecosystem, particularly in Africa, since Project Catalyst Fund 1. My roles as the Funded Proposer’s Representative on Catalyst Circle v3, and member of the Civics Committee drafting the Cardano Constitution and working group member facilitating the global Constitutional Workshops have given me deep insights into structuring and resourcing community-led initiatives for success.

Currently, I am working with community leaders Jo Alum (who is also a founding member of the Cardano Eastern Council), and Jose De Gamboa (a Cardano thought leader, Civics Committee member and an economist) on a Cardano Resiliency SIG (special interest group). This initiative began in July 2024, during the Longmont Cardano Constitution draftathon, where we recognized the need to explore models for sustaining Cardano’s treasury within a 45B cap, while ensuring robust growth of the protocol and community beyond seven generations. My work on the Civics Committee will end in April 2025 as I transition to the Budget Committee should my bid be successful.

Having held Ada since 2017, I firmly believe that the Cardano treasury should be used to push community resourcing, building, meaningful participation and decision-making to the edges. My hands-on experience in the ecosystem allows me to bring a community-focused approach to the Budget Committee, ensuring treasury funds are allocated to projects that drive real grassroot innovation and transaction volume increase, while being managed sustainably for the long-term benefit of the entire Cardano ecosystem.
