<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

Transparency, Flexibility and Community-driven really stood out to me. I noticed that transparency is the number one thing that never gets delivered to the general community. I understand that certain countries and companies have NDA's, but whenever the top brass communicates about the NDA's and tries to avoid talking about the issue, it's always in the most corporate soulless method possible. We've lost a lot of community members because of this. The budget also needs to be flexible because I think many members of intersect may fail to take into account the various circumstances and laws of countries they provide funding to when promoting Cardano workshops and activities.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Intersect seems to much more proactive with Cardano than the previous CF interactions. Have been with Cardano for almost 4 years now and I'm glad to see that it's finally opening up to southern nations.

<details>

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

To better communicate with the community and also provide a voice for the members of the community that often don't have the time or are tech-savvy enough to do it themselves.

</details>



<details>

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

Because I believe a represent a large portion of the Cardano community in what they want to prioritize the budget for. Not a lot of the senseless things that the top brass often grants funding to that nobody among regular ADA holders support.

<details>

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

My only other possible conflict of interest is that I am also a dRep, but I've been fairly consistent and transparent about my activities in all things related to blockchains and Cardano.
