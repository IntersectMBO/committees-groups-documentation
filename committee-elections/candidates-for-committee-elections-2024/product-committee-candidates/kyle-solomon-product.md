I am a long-term Cardano stake pool operator (FROG) and have helped onboard dozens of stake pool operators. I minted Cardano's first meme coin (spacecoins), created Cardano's first native asset dispenser to subsidize staking rewards (Adosia), and co-founded Cardano's premium rewards layer (DripDropz).&#x20;

I am currently working as a volunteer with Intersect by contributing subject matter expertise to assist the Open Source and Product committees. I actively contribute with SWOT analysis, deep utility analysis and roadmap goals. I hosted a Constitutional Workshop in Puerto Rico and will be attending the upcoming Cardano Constitutional Convention in Argentina as an alternate delegate.
