<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been contributing to Cardano since 2018, including pre-Shelley Jormungandr node testing, Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), and the Ariob Incubator Bootcamp, an iceaddis/IOG program for startups building on Cardano.&#x20;

I have been involved in all aspects of Catalyst since Fund 0, including being funded in Funds 5 and 11. I have run many in person community meetups and Cardano Summit events. I have contributed to different Intersect working groups, including as chair of the Stablecoins Working Group. I was also selected as a DRep Pioneer Program leader to deliver workshops for community members who wish to learn how to become a DRep.&#x20;

I am a member of the Eastern Cardano Council, who were recently elected to the Interim Constitutional Committee. Also, as the Co-Founder of Empowa and other projects building on Cardano, I have a long term investment in the Cardano community, and therefore appreciate the importance of ensuring that Cardano’s capabilities continue to evolve and grow to support new initiatives.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

In addition to supporting the next generation roadmap for Cardano as a public domain infrastructure platform, I believe there is an opportunity for Intersect to take on some of the responsibilities previously performed by the founding entities, by engaging with enterprises looking to leverage blockchain technology for their business.

I would therefore like to see the Product Committee explore these opportunities in collaboration with Intersect’s members, ensuring that Cardano’s product roadmap is fit for purpose. I would bring my experience on both sides of large enterprise technology tenders and projects (i.e. as a customer and a vendor), to develop a strategic plan that will enable this vision.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I have a Computer Science degree, am a TOGAF certified Enterprise Architect and have worked in the IT industry for over 25 years. I therefore have a strong technical background, am an experienced technology communicator, and can leverage my experience designing and implementing solutions for organisations from startups and SMEs to large corporations and government departments, to help shape the vision for Cardano’s next stage of enterprise adoption.&#x20;
