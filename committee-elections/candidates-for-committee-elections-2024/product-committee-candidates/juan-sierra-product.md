<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Experience with Cardano&#x20;

As a Cardano Business Developer with over five years of involvement in the Cardano ecosystem, I have consistently focused on driving the growth and adoption of Cardano technology. With a technical background from Emurgo’s Cardano Developer Professional program (Batch 59, Haskell, 2022) and as a collaborator with Gimbalabs since day one, my career spans governance, strategy development, and community engagement. My mission is centered on expanding Cardano’s reach into local governments, educational institutions, and business enterprises, ensuring the broad adoption of the blockchain's decentralized technology.

I have been a committed participant in Cardano since the Incentivized Test Network (ITN) in 2019, contributing to various onboarding initiatives with underserved communities. My co-founding of LATAM Town Hall, Sala de Café, the Cardano Confederation, and other initiatives has allowed me to play a significant role in uniting global communities under the Cardano banner. My active participation as a Catalyst Member since Fund 1, attending key events like the Catalyst Fund 12 Launch and the Catalyst Working Group Workshop in Barcelona, highlights my ongoing commitment to the technical and community aspects of Cardano’s ecosystem to ensure equality. I regularly organize local meetups and engage in teaching blockchain basics as part of my onboarding efforts.

Experience with Intersect

As an Intersect Interim Constitutional Council Alternate, I have become deeply involved in the governance processes that guide Cardano’s future. I co-hosted the first Constitutional Workshop in Argentina (August 2, 2024), and attended the Fort Myers Constitutional Workshop on September 20, 2024. These workshops have reinforced my belief in transparent governance, and I have actively contributed to discussions that define Cardano's constitutional framework.

While I have not previously held a position on the Product Committee, my involvement in Intersect workshops, governance events, and technical working groups has thoroughly prepared me to make meaningful contributions. I have actively supported initiatives aligned with the Product Committee’s mission of developing a transparent and inclusive roadmap for Cardano, striking a crucial balance between community input and technical innovation.

In addition to my blockchain expertise, I bring over 30 years of experience in personal development, sustainability practices, and compliance in traditional industries, along with an open-minded mentality and a growth mindset with a strong desire to learn and improve. This background enables me to contribute a unique perspective that will greatly enhance the Product Committee’s ability to fulfill its long-term vision. My experience with legacy systems provides valuable insights as we work to position Cardano as a forward-thinking, sustainable blockchain that integrates seamlessly with both emerging technologies and community-driven governance.

My deep involvement in these initiatives highlights my commitment to ethics and inclusivity, particularly in underserved communities where access to blockchain technology can create significant positive change.

Furthermore, my background in blockchain business development and community governance makes me uniquely equipped to contribute to the Product Committee. I am dedicated to ensuring that all voices are heard, and I believe strongly in promoting inclusion as a foundational value in Cardano’s future. My experience with both technical strategy and community-driven decision-making positions me to help the Product Committee foster transparency and equity, ensuring Cardano's growth benefits all segments of the global community.
