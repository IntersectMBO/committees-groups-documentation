<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I pledge to maintain focus on the health and growth of the protocol and the evolution of the software to the benefit of the future community. Without the community there is no use for the protocol but with out the protocol there would be no community to use it, an unbreakable relationship.
