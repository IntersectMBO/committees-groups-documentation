<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Cardano Since 2022, work with SickCity Music and Minting Services, StripperCoin(ZenPro), and took over the OG Leaf Token project, JukeboysNFTs community as well as Admin roles in a few other communities.&#x20;

Work with SickCity started out just for my own teams projects at So Litty Records(My Web2 Business/Label), but quickly interested me to get involved more. Thru CIP 60, our team saw opportunity to utilize cardano for the Data Standardization use case but for Music Distribution and eventually Streaming, Payments, and as we have been pioneering with our partners at NEWM(Who we built the NFT Marketplace for) tokenization of music rights! I have personally been able to preform JSON level tasks and work within SickCity as of late much more heavily to provide our Music to the Cardano chain every 5 days as we have for more than 2 years! Now under the JukeboysNFTs moniker, our JukeBoxElite NFTs are a continuation of the Time Honored SickCity Epochs that we've seen since in the Epoch 300ish range. Our work with partners like ARP Radio and NEWM have also allowed us the team needed to pen the CIP 60 v3 metadata standard now merged into the CF GitHub and the official standard for music tokens on Cardano. This standard is the combined Web2 Music Industry Standard metadata and royalty functions built in to the Cardano chain and formatted to fit our chains data limitations while protecting artists IP rights.&#x20;

Work with StripperCoin was primarily marketing, with some heavy onboarding efforts from IRL Adult Industry Conventions and Trade Conferences like Exxxotica and XBIZ via my contacts in the Adult Industry. We worked to showcase various use cases for blockchain and outline our intentions to build a safer, more creator friendly set of tools via Web3 Cardano tech to turn the Adult Entertainment Industry on it's head. We built the first Adult NFT marketplace on Cardano, and have built tools like GASM.io to provide the ecosystem with better native AI Image Generators.&#x20;

LEAF token was one of the first memecoins on Cardano and dates to around the HOSKY era, beat only by a few weeks. It was destined to rug but seeing the huge holderbase and community behind it me and SickCity's Jimmy didn't wanna see it fail. We stepped up and took on the project. We are building the brand to provide Web2 onboarding thru Leafy Green joy and the future release of products branded by Cardano and LEAF imagery. Really a great marketing opportunity as the Glowing Weed Charles Narrative moves forward.&#x20;

I would like to also say that cardano as changed my life in so many ways. I had never considered tech as an opportunity for me. Had I not been brought here in 2022 my life may well be very different. So many leaders in this Cardano blockchain have poured their energy and knowledge into me and I owe this chain my best.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

I will work to ensure that Intersect builds Transparency into all of the aspects of our governance, build a system of accountability, provide official studies and reports to the community as to where we may have made mistakes in the initial ICC rollout and subsequent internal decision making. I pledge to do my very best for Cardano and the wide range of people here and I feel I represent within the ecosystem to ensure that the Intersect we build for the community is open, transparent, clear in scope, and capable of accomplishing the huge tasks ahead all while driving increased community participation to intersect thru my personal channels.

<details>

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

I have proven time and time again to not only be willing to bat for the community up against any potential threats to our ecosystem, but also act on my own and take initiative to BE THE CHANGE when needed. I Love Cardano
