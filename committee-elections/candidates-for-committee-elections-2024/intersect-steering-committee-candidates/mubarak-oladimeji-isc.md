<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I am Mubarak Oladimeji, also known as Kit Willow on Discord and X (Twitter) I have been following the Cardano ecosystem for a while but I didn’t take a deep dive until Project Catalyst Fund 11 where I participated as a community reviewer, and finished with a 100% approval rate. Naturally, I was very much interested in diving deeper into the Cardano ecosystem and I started frequenting communities that were renowned to be building on the Cardano Blockchain, some of which include&#x20;

Remostart and Smart Contract Audit to mention a few. After Fund 11, I aligned with a friend and colleague of mine who was also invested in the Cardano ecosystem. Together, with the help of other core members, we founded NexTrend Labs and I assumed the role of the Chief Operating Officer (COO). My work with NexTrend Labs has been rewarding as we have been able to establish a functional Cardano-based community in Nigeria and achieved some milestones, including hosting a DReP workshop at the University of Lagos, even without receiving funds from Intersect.&#x20;

I participated in Project Catalyst, Fund 12 as well, both as a project owner (courtesy of NexTrend Labs) and as a community reviewer. Though I was saddened by the fact that none of the projects I submitted by proxy through NexTrend Labs were funded, I did not let it deter me from contributing further to the Cardano ecosystem. I finished the community review process of Fund 12 with an approval rate of 90%, effectively earning my place as an L1 reviewer. I can say that I eagerly look forward to the start of Fund 13. I got really involved with Intersect very early in 2024 and joined the Intersect Discord server. I have been an active participant in real-life Intersect events organized in my region, Lagos Nigeria. The first of which was the Intersect Meetup, and then the DReP Workshop, both hosted by Remostart. I also organized and hosted a DReP event, as the COO and a Team Member of NexTrend Labs, which we hosted without receiving grants from Intersect or any other bodies. Likewise, I was also a participant in my region’s Constitutional Workshop and was honoured to be elected as one of the delegates to represent my region at the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires. I am an active participant in Intersect, mostly working with and in alignment with the Transparency and Marketing Working Groups. Also, I have been — and still — is an active presence and contributor in Intersect on Discord, X and so on, operating under the alias Kit Willow. I have joined many space calls, zoom and google meetings to contribute my fair share in bettering not just Intersect, but the Cardano ecosystem as a whole. Thank you.

The Steering Committee is or will be one of the most important and significant committees, as it brings together the heads of all other committees to a broader and more collaborative decision making process. My plans are to work as a Steering Committee member to ensure that no stone is left unturned in the pursuit of a better Cardano ecosystem. I embody and aim to further implement the principles and core values of Cardano, of which every committee should live and abide by. Transparency and fairness will be integrated to ensure unbiased decision making. Thank you.

If I am elected as a committee member, and entrusted with a high level of responsibility and decision-making, I’ll ensure that I maintain a degree of integrity and transparency towards myself and the general Cardano community, to ensure the core principles of Intersect and Cardano are maintained Lastly, I am an active member of the community, on several working groups, Discord and X(Twitter) and I’m invested in the betterment of Intersect and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.
