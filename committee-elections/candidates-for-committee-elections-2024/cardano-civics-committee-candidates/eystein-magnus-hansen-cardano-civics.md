<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

Continue the work on facilitating a ratification period for the constitution. I also hope to keep the constitutional work alive after ratification with helping organize constitutional events and educational material. I consider the work on the constitution as a life long project and something I am truly passionate about.&#x20;

Due to my research in governance I also hope in particular to continue work on providing non-binding recommendations as requested by the community regarding Cardano governance improvements as is also one of the current mandates of the civics committee.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

Continue extensive research and work on the Cardano constitution and its participatory governance system, and ensure that the constitutional work does not stop after ratification - we are going to learn a lot from actually doing participatory governance that will generate data for us to refine and improve the future of Cardano governance.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

The work on the Cardano constitution is something I have given everything in me for, and is my life's work and what I would highlight as my main contributing area. I have probably used all my spare time on this during the last 12 months or so and attended multiple governance events. I hope to be able to continue this work and be formally recognized for it by other Intersect members.&#x20;

I also cherish the other work I have done at civics committee. For example after the drafting phase of the working group I am now quite engaged in the ratification phase working on the feedback we have gotten from the different workshops and ensuring results are audited and legitimized. Some of the things I have contributed to is discussing a principle of harmonizing code and law and the relationship between the code and the constitution social law. I also made a comparative framework for comparing the Cardano constitution to other constitutions. Together with other colleagues we discussed concept such as human speed of governance actions in AI era and we did initial work and feedback on arbitration systems paving the way for establishing a legal system on Cardano that could be acknowledged by other nation states. I also looked into what human rights could fit into the Cardano constitution. I also read 22 research papers on top of the other research papers provided by others and gave feedback on them to the rest of the constitution ratification working group and introduced several ideas and principles to consider based on the knowledge from the research papers.&#x20;

In short if you think what I do is valuable for Intersect and the Civics committee please consider a vote to me. I would be very gratefull to be able to continue this governance journey.

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

I own North Block AS where I do consultancy/ambassador work for Cardano projects (currently Iagon ambassador as I hope to encourage L0 decentralization at the infrastructure level) as well as grant work for Catalyst, Intersect and other grant work in the future. I have also collaborated with Photrek through North Block AS such as coauthoring a governance research paper. (preprint link: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4911180). North Block AS has sponsored a Latam Cardano community event and will continue to support the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

My day job is for Norwegian Block Exchange a cryptocurrency exchange with main office in Norway. Here I am an SPO and run the staking pool Ada North Pool (ticker ANP) on behalf of NBX who acquired the staking pool from me when I started working at NBX.&#x20;

I hold a seat at the Intersect Constitutional Council for the interim constitution period.&#x20;

I am a cofounder of the Nordic Cardano Community. We have held multiple workshops on Cardano and governance over the years in Norway, where I have been part of the people organizing and presenting at such events. I publish research on Cardano governance such as the currently in preprint paper I am a coauthor on: "Sociocratic Pluralism Governance for Blockchain Ecosystems" https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4911180&#x20;

I might join as an advisor to a DRep organization an in the future if I see no conflict of interest or after my tenure in the ICC I might join a DRep organization fully with voting rights as well.
