<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been actively involved with the Cardano ecosystem through Coin Cylon as its COO from 2021, driven by our passion for decentralized solutions and blockchain innovation.

Throughout this time, I have had the opportunity to contribute to projects in various capacities, expanding my knowledge while helping to foster community growth in Sri Lanka.

In 2021, Coin Ceylon was the first stake pool operator in Sri Lanka. In 2022, we created and minted our first multipurpose NFT collection on the Cadano ecosystem. We also held and led multiple events to educate the community on our NFT and about the Cardano ecosystem. We showcased to the community how to use the Cardano ecosystem so that they understand how it can be used for transparency and reliability.

Most of our events were featured in the local newspaper articles and also televised. As COO, I was the main organizer for all the events and coordinated r to ensure everything ran smoothly. The members of Coin Ceylon also attended the Cardano Summit in Dubai last year where we learned about all the projects and the future of the ecosystem.

At the beginning of this year, we joined Intersect and became the first hub in southeast Asia which helped put Sri Lanka on the map. Working together with our hub manager Kavinda, we hit the ground running. We had over 2,000 visitors to the stall we held at the international industrial EXPO in Sri Lanka. We also hosted multiple Townhall meetings with over 200 people in attendance due to the remarkable amount of people willing to learn and help expand the knowledge of the ecosystem.
