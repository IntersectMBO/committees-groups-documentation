<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

I am particularly interested in a role within the Civics Committee focused on updating guidelines, templates, and standards for on-chain voting, as well as providing non-binding recommendations regarding Cardano governance improvements. My background in community engagement and governance processes positions me well to help streamline voting procedures, ensuring they are user-friendly and accessible to all participants.

I believe that by refining these guidelines, we can enhance the overall voting experience, making it easier for community members to engage in the decision-making process. Additionally, my commitment to transparency and collaboration drives my desire to gather and synthesize community feedback, allowing us to provide meaningful recommendations for governance improvements. This role aligns with my passion for fostering an inclusive environment where every voice can contribute to shaping the future of Cardano.

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been an active member of Cardano since Fund6 of Project Catalyst in August 2021, consistently educating myself on Cardano’s core principles and sharing this knowledge within Latin America. I proposed a Fund7 mentorship and educational outreach initiative to onboard new members from Ecuador and Paraguay into the Cardano ecosystem. I also helped organize Cardano meet-ups in New York City with support from local Cardano ambassadors. Additionally, I was involved in creating a Cardano film during Fund8 to promote Cardano’s use cases and active projects within the Latin American community.

Currently, I am leading a Fund12 project aimed at educating new Cardano members in Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela with the support of local hubs. Since early 2024, I’ve become more involved in Intersect, contributing to the marketing working group, hosting a constitutional workshop in Bolivia, and assisting with one in Paraguay. I have participated in dRep pioneers workshops hosted by Hosky to explore Cardano governance, attended the Rare Evo budget workshop, and have been an active participant in Cardano Summits.
