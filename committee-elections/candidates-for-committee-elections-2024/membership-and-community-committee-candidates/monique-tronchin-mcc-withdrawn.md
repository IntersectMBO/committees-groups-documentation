<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

Community and building connection are core components of my personal value system. They are also the foundations of my professional life (http://www.greencitrine.com). Following, obtaining a role on the Membership & Community Committee would be something that I would take seriously as the Cardano community is what drew me to this ecosystem. I also enjoy planning, organizing events and working with people in general.
