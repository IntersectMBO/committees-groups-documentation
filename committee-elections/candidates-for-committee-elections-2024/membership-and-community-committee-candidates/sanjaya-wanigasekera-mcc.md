<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been following the Cardano ecosystem and its developments since its early stages with great interest. As the Community Manager for Coin Ceylon Sri Lanka which was established in 2021, I have executed my role with much enthusiasm. I have worked with Coin Ceylon in contributing and building on Cardano while introducing Cardano and blockchain technology to the local stage . As Coin Ceylon was appointed as the 3rd Intersect hub and the 1st hub in South East Asia, I have been engaging closely with the appointed hub manager and my colleagues to build and expand the community in Sri Lanka while educating our associate and founding members about the purpose of Intersect and Cardano ecosystem. Additionally I have experience in organizing local Intersect hub events and hosting Cardano based virtual events throughout the years.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

If I am elected I pledge to explore a framework where school and university students could access Intersects resources in more affordable manner, so that future generations can also contribute towards cardano development early on. Furthermore I believe education plays a vital role in this ecosystem and due that fact I pledge to explore avenues focused on helping educate existing and potential new members with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate this ever growing industry.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

Operating as the Community Manager for Coin Ceylon which was appointed as the 3rd Intersect hub, I have actively engaged with the local hub members in spreading awareness of Intersects purpose and vision for the Cardano community. As a result of this engagement and multiple events we as a hub have hosted has allowed us gather a large community from Sri Lanka who believe in Cardano and the future. If I am elected I am confident that I can continue to contribute towards this cause while ensuring that all Intersect members get the best of what Intersect has to offer.
