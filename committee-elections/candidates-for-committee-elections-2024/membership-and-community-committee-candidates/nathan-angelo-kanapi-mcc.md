Nathan Angelo Kanapi

<details>

<summary>Are you currently part of the committee they are applying for?</summary>

No

</details>



<details>

<summary>Is there a particular role within the committee that you are interested in, if so which and why? (if applicable)</summary>

The 3rd part of the description (community support, grants, education, and events) stands out to me as it has always been my goal to educate the masses about using blockchains (particularly Cardano) as an alternative to FIAT systems that often suffer from a lot of middlemen corruption.

<details>

<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

Intersect seems to much more proactive with Cardano than the previous CF interactions. Have been with Cardano for almost 4 years now and I'm glad to see that it's finally opening up to southern nations.

<details>

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

To be the bridge between Cardano leadership and the regular members/community. I often notice that the developers and leadership of Cardano are unable to properly communicate and interact with most of the community. Call it a cultural or social economic barrier, I notice a lot gets lost in communication and too many disagreements happen.

<details>

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

Cardano whale said it best when he quoted my dRep post on Twitter calling me the "global south representative". Having lived in the Philippines most of my life but having worked in my fellow developing nations and first world nations, I have a general understanding of the mindset and thinking from both social economic and cultural backgrounds.

<details>

<summary>Do you have any other Cardano affiliations or possible conflicts of interests, including you as an individual or an enterprise you are associated with?</summary>

My only other possible conflict of interest is that I am also a dRep, but I've been fairly consistent and transparent about my activities in all things related to blockchains and Cardano.

<details>

<summary>Are you currently in receipt of or previously received any Intersect or Cardano funding or grant?</summary>

Have been provided with the 50% initial funding for the Manila workshop this coming October.
