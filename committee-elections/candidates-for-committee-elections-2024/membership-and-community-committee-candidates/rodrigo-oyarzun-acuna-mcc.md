<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

I have been a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) for the Cardano network, managing blockchain infrastructure and providing staking services to over 1,000 customers globally. With more than 4 years of experience, I’ve dedicated myself to creating educational content aimed at democratizing access to blockchain technology. My passion for fostering a robust ecosystem has led me to collaborate closely with universities, promoting blockchain literacy across Latin America, where I believe it can become a significant competitive advantage.

Throughout my journey, I’ve participated in key events within the Cardano community. I organized and took part in the Buenos Aires 2022 hackathon, delivered classes at Universidad Adolfo Ibañez in 2023, and led the CIP 1694 online workshop, which explored governance within the Cardano ecosystem. Additionally, I have been working on establishing blockchain laboratories at both Universidad Adolfo Ibañez and Universidad Miguel de Cervantes, with plans to launch them in 2024.

In 2024, I completed the Cardano developers course at UTN Buenos Aires, and I was a member of the organizing team for the Constitutional Workshop in Buenos Aires, which strengthened the Cardano community in Argentina. Currently, I am involved with Intersect, where I host the constitutional workshop in Santiago, Chile, engaging with a diverse audience to further explore governance on the Cardano blockchain.

<summary>What are your pledges and plans should you be elected?</summary>

My priorities include establishing clear and efficient communication channels between the community and the committee to support the structured global development of our network. I am committed to providing transparent communication about community-driven projects, including their timelines for application and execution, in alignment with Intersect’s guidelines. Additionally, I aim to expand our membership base, both individual and enterprise, to strengthen the organization. A key focus will be reducing language barriers for non-English speaking communities, enhancing access to information, and fostering greater international collaboration.

<summary>Why should the community vote for you?</summary>

The community should vote for me because I bring over four years of hands-on experience as a Stake Pool Operator and active contributor to the Cardano ecosystem, both through technical infrastructure management and community-building initiatives. My deep commitment to fostering blockchain literacy in Latin America, combined with my work in organizing educational events and developing blockchain labs, showcases my ability to bridge gaps and strengthen the global community.

I aim to ensure clear communication between the committee and the community, offering transparency and support for project timelines and applications. My focus on expanding membership, particularly by addressing the needs of non-English speaking communities, reflects my vision for a truly inclusive, diverse, and stronger Intersect organization. I believe my experience, passion for education, and ability to connect with global stakeholders make me a valuable asset to the community.
