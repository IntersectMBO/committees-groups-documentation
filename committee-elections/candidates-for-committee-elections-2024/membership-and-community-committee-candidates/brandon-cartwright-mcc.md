<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

My involvement within the Cardano ecosystem has been both comprehensive and impactful. I have actively engaged with the community, staying informed on Cardano’s cutting-edge blockchain developments and governance models. As a dedicated advocate for decentralization and innovative solutions, I have been a consistent participant in key discussions surrounding Cardano’s growth, particularly those aligned with the principles of community-led governance. Though I am seeking a more formal role within Intersect, I have been following its formation closely and understand the critical importance of its mission in fostering a collaborative environment for all stakeholders in the Cardano ecosystem. I aim to contribute my insights and passion for decentralized governance to the Intersect Committees of 2024, ensuring that the interests of the wider community are represented fairly and inclusively.
