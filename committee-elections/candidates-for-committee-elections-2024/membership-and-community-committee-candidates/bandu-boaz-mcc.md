<summary>What is your experiences within Intersect and Cardano?</summary>

My passion for environmental and sustainability issues naturally led me to explore blockchain technology, and Cardano’s commitment to a greener future truly resonated with me. I’ve been actively involved in Cardano’s journey through various roles:&#x20;

Co-Proposing Funds 8 and 9: I played a key role in proposing and shaping these funding initiatives, which helped advance Cardano’s projects and foster community-driven innovations. Coordinating an NFT Project in Fund 9: I coordinated this project, managing its development and execution, which allowed me to engage creatively with Cardano’s ecosystem.&#x20;

Serving as a Community Reviewer in Funds 10 and 11: My role involved evaluating project proposals and providing insights to ensure they met Cardano’s standards and objectives.&#x20;

Verifying Proof of Life and Moderating Fund 11: I verified the legitimacy of project participants and moderated discussions, contributing to the integrity and success of Fund 11 initiatives.&#x20;

Beyond these specific roles, I’ve focused on expanding Cardano’s reach in Africa:&#x20;

Authored a Research Paper (March 2023): I analyzed African Stake Pools, which contributed to a better understanding of Cardano’s potential in the region.&#x20;

Facilitated a Virtual CIP-1694 Workshop (June 2023): I led this workshop to engage the community and discuss Cardano’s governance improvements. Contributed to an In-Person CIP-1694 Workshop in Accra, Ghana (June 2023): My participation in this workshop helped strengthen Cardano’s presence and governance discussions in Africa.&#x20;

Hosted the “Catalyst Africa Town Hall: Bridging the Gap for Continental Expansion” Workshop (December 2023): This event focused on expanding Cardano’s influence across the continent and bridging gaps within the community.&#x20;

Co-Organized Workshops on Governance and Community Engagement in Goma (2021 & 2022 Summits): I helped organize these workshops, emphasizing the importance of governance and local engagement. Goma Stake Pool Manager: Managing the Goma Stake Pool reflects my commitment to supporting and growing Cardano’s presence in the region. In addition to my work with Cardano, I’ve also been actively involved with Intersect:&#x20;

Member and Proposal Reviewer: I’ve participated as a member and reviewer, contributing to the assessment and guidance of proposals within Intersect.&#x20;

Hosted Workshops: I have hosted several Intersect workshops, including the DReps Pioneer Program (Co-host), Intersect Meet-ups (Co-host), and the Launch of the Central Africa Regional Hub.&#x20;

Elected to Represent the Community in Buenos Aires (December 2024): Recently, I hosted a workshop on the Cardano Constitution and was honored to be elected to represent the community in Buenos Aires later this year.&#x20;

My involvement with both Cardano and Intersect reflects my dedication to blockchain technology, governance, and community development, with a particular focus on sustainability and regional expansion.
