Since March 2024, I have been a member of Intersect, an organization committed to promoting democratic governance. I recently participated in the voting action for the three seats of the interim constitutional committee, demonstrating my commitment to democratic decision-making.

As a co-host of an Intersect-funded workshop on Cardano on-chain governance with UPDC Nyiragongo, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge about Cardano and its roadmaps. I particularly focused on the Voltaire era and the latest news in decentralized governance, thus contributing to enriching the discussions.

In 2023, I also participated in an online workshop on CIP-1694 with Goma Hub, demonstrating my interest in decentralized governance issues with the Voltaire era at Cardano.

Between April 25 and May 9, 2024, under the supervision of Ms. Gemma Dakin, Head of Tooling and Community Engagement-Grants at Intersect, I was part of the working group in charge of evaluating grant applications for inclusion and accessibility, with a particular focus on the categories of open space and town halls.

Finally, from June 18 to July 1, 2024, still under the direction of Ms. Gemma Dakin, I was an evaluator in the working group in charge of examining applications for hosting and organizing constitutional workshops for the European region. My commitment to these missions was formalized by the signing of a contract before taking office, here is
