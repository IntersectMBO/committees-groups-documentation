# Technical Working Groups

## Purpose / Goal

Technical working groups are special in the sense of their formation and purpose, these working groups have been formed specifically on the request of the [Open Source](https://app.gitbook.com/s/o50OuflyxfUMOt8hHPn2/intersect-overview/intersect-committees/open-source-committee-osc) and [Technical Steering Committee ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/o50OuflyxfUMOt8hHPn2/intersect-overview/intersect-committees/technical-steering-committee-tsc)at Intersect. They have been designed to complement the current [continuity](https://app.gitbook.com/s/o50OuflyxfUMOt8hHPn2/cardano/cardano-continuity) development structure. The ambition is to allow the community to plug-in to the core development of Cardano. These technical working groups are expected to operate within the confines of the [Open Source Office Governance](https://intersect.gitbook.io/open-source-committee/policies/governance).

For ease these initial technical working groups have been created by the existing core development teams however we expect them to adapt to the needs and interests of the community over time.

These technical working groups may not have a finite period of operation and could be indefinite depending on the hosting committee needs.&#x20;

## Related committee

Technical Steering Committee - to review or propose proposals of technical concern

Open Source Committee - to build a broader cohort of maintainers and contributors, to help projects interface with core Cardano

## Working group lead

Initially whilst in bootstrap and interim phases the technical working group leads will be an appropriate engineer from an existing continuity development team. A ‘meet the engineer’ approach, who can offer expertise and insight on the specific tech stack.&#x20;

## Working group members

Like any other working group community and members are encouraged to join and, initially, learn about core Cardano development and contribute to these core elements.&#x20;

## Collaboration channels&#x20;

To be agreed by the individual technical working groups, like any other working group, and as long as it is open to the community.

## Next steps

Over the coming weeks and months these technical working groups will be advertised and incubated by our steering committees. Ultimately we hope these groups become mature centres of excellence for the core development of Cardano. A place were like minded individuals can discuss, create and evaluate proposals for these essential components.&#x20;

Our initial Technical Working Groups are outlined in the following section.
