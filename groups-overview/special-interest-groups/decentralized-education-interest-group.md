# Decentralized Education Interest Group

## Purpose / Goal

The desired outcome of decentralized education is a flexible, inclusive, and resilient education system that leverages blockchain, peer-to-peer networks, and open-source platforms. This system should democratize educational content, reduce costs, enhance transparency, and facilitate global collaboration. Ultimately, the group envisions an improved educational landscape where barriers are minimized, learning is personalized, and the community is empowered with greater control over educational processes and resources.

The objective of the decentralized education interest group is to innovate and enhance educational practices by promoting the use of decentralized technologies. The group aims to create a learner-centric ecosystem that emphasizes educational equity, personalized learning, and widespread access to resources.
