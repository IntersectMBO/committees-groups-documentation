# Layer 2

{% hint style="info" %}
The working group is currently being formed and a [dedicated git repository](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-layer2) was chosen to form [charter](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-layer2/blob/main/README.md#hydra-working-group) and processes. This document here is a copy / index of important sections from the charter.&#x20;

Now is the time to get involved if you want to align on Layer 2 technology, stay up-to-date on Cardano Layer 2 projects, or shape the future of Hydra concretely to make our [overall vision on Cardano scaling](https://cardano-scaling.org/#vision) come true.
{% endhint %}

## Purpose / Goal

> Why is this working group needed?

* Break up silos and cross-pollinate projects across the broader domain of scaling Cardano transaction processing
* Identify and scope _fundable features_ and projects related to Layer 2 technology to be ratified by the community (e.g. through intersect)
* Open discussion and governance of the [hydra](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra) project roadmap

## Related committee

[Intersect - Technical Steering Committee](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/Yzy77cQuAEYNjeNy3YrN/ "mention")

## Working group lead

* Sebastian Nagel (founding / interim)

## Working group members

Any stakeholder or enthusiast is free to join this working group, whether working for an organisation in the ecosystem or not.

New members must participate in one meeting and state their interest in joining the group. Members may not vote in the first meeting that they attend.

## Working group deliverables

> What are we doing concretely?

* Share progress and gather feedback on individual project deliveries
* Discuss standards and [Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs) related to layer 2
* Prioritize and get feedback for individual project features (e.g. [Hydra features](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature))
* Chat about new layer 2 catalyst proposals and long term layer 2 projects, for example Midgard, zkFold, subbit, Cardano Lightning, Î¼graph, ...
