# 🐉 Hydra

{% hint style="info" %}
The working group is currently being formed and a [dedicated git repository](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra) was chosen to form [charter](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra/blob/main/README.md#hydra-working-group) and processes. This document here is a copy / index of important sections from the charter.&#x20;

The charter itself is in draft status and the first work item of the working group will be to ratify it. This includes any procedures around membership.

Now is the time to get involved if you want to shape the future of Hydra concretely, and what features / related projects are to be funded to which make our [overall vision on Cardano scaling](https://cardano-scaling.org/#vision) come true.
{% endhint %}

## Purpose / Goal

> Why is this working group needed?

* Open discussion and governance of the [hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra) project roadmap
* Identify and scope _fundable features_ and projects related to Hydra into a roadmap to be ratified by the community (e.g. through intersect)
* Break up silos and cross-pollinate projects across the broader domain of scaling Cardano transaction processing

## Related committee
