## Working group objective / desired outcome

In more detail, we see it as developing and maintaining best practice standards for audit and certification, as well as championing the process of certification. Beyond that we see potential for roadmapping tools and technologies, for fostering collaboration between tool builders and providers, interaction with similar bodies for other blockchains, and so forth.
