# Open Source Project Framework Working Group

### Purpose/Goals

Establish a clear and efficient process for nurturing and advancing open source projects, ensuring they align with organizational goals and contribute meaningfully to the broader community.

According to the [Open Source Strategy](https://intersect.gitbook.io/open-source-committee/open-source-strategy) (approved by OSC on March 28, 2024), our first goal is audit all Intersect maintained Cardano projects by the end of 2024 (with 50% of projects having a diversified funding model):

Goal 1 - By Q4, 2024, all Intersect-maintained Cardano projects will have been audited and made decisions, based on the Project Lifecycle Framework, about their sustainability, risk mitigation strategy, and possible post-mortem actions (if applicable).

In order to achieve that, we decided on three main initiatives:

* Establish the project lifecycle framework
* Evaluate projects according to the Lifecycle Framework&#x20;
* Implement project support items&#x20;

First step is to define the framework. This framework will include guidelines for project stages, key milestones, success metrics, risk indicators, intervention strategies, and post-mortem actions. A plan for continuously monitoring projects will also be included.&#x20;

The main reason for doing that is to understand projectsâ€™ current phase, health, and sustainability.&#x20;

### Committee(s)

* OSC
* TSC

### Membership

* Christian Taylor
* Daniel Firth
* Alex Seregin (Lead)
* Silona Bonewald
* Bogdan Coman

### Projected Deliverables

The end goal is to have in place, fully defined by the end of Q2 the Project Framework. This deadline is critical in order to be able to fully audit all the projects by the end of 2024.

Phases (initial proposal, to be discussed with the working group)

* Establish the scope - what project means, what lifecycle means, what E2E means
* Create and agree on sections, or phases: idea management, inception, validation, prioritization, incubation, maturity, sunset.&#x20;
* Create initial draft for phases, with monitoring, and process initial draft - to be validated with the other stakeholders
* Fully define the framework, establish the ceremonies.
* Small pilot, if is possible, with one of the projects

### Collaboration Channels

Discord (OSC WG Forum)
