# GMC - Enterprise & Governance Adoption Working Group

### Purpose

The Enterprise & Government Adoption (EGA) Working Group was established, following approval from the Growth and Marketing Committee, to explore ways to grow the adoption of Cardano by established enterprise businesses and government organisations.

The EGA working group will initially focus on the following areas:

1. Enterprise Strategy - Engage with SMEs and/or growth strategy firms to develop strategies specifically targeted towards the increased adoption of Cardano by established enterprise organisations.  If necessary, strategies may be tailored towards specific industries.
2. Government Strategy - Engage with SMEs and/or growth strategy firms to develop strategies specifically targeted towards the increased adoption of Cardano by governments.  Such strategies may vary depending on the needs of different types of government organisations (e.g. local, state, national).
3. Engagement  Partners - Identify and develop partnerships with consultants/agencies who can execute against adoption strategies, by directly engaging with different enterprise and government organisations globally.  A register of solution builders within the Cardano ecosystem may be leveraged to provide referrals for leads established by engagement partners.
4. Education Partners - To support engagement partners in attracting enterprises and governments to use Cardano, specialised education material may be required.  The EGA working group will establish partnerships with educational content creators, to prepare targeted content.&#x20;

The EGA working group will make recommendations to the Growth and Marketing Committee for execution, and will re-assess its remit in December 2025.  An assessment will be made on whether to continue the working group into 2026.  If continued, the working group may operate under a newly defined charter, or with a view to iterate on its 2025 approach and recommendations.

### WG Deliverables

1. Enhance [cardano.org](http://cardano.org) website for enterprise and government visitors, to direct them to information sources that will suit their requirements (user journeys).&#x20;
2. Create an ecosystem mapping tool that:
   1. Provides a register of Cardano partners for enterprise and government adoption, with appropriate guardrails and inclusion criteria.
   2. Lists robust tooling that these players can use. Veridian, Reeve, and others in the ecosystem.
   3. Identifies favorable jurisdictions for enterprise and government adoption.
3. Develop a framework for anyone in the ecosystem to adopt for onboarding enterprise and government organisations to Cardano.
