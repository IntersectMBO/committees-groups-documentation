**Formal / Informal**

1. Formal - there are rules for it here.
2. Informal - there are no rules for it here.

For both the formal and informal status, the group is accountable for the decisions it makes to the group that it reports to.&#x20;

**Caveats to ‘Formal / Informal’**

1. Informal - if there are no rules for something, it doesn’t mean it’s unimportant what or how the decisions are made. It just means that its best to leave the quality of those decisions to the governance structure of the group and of Intersect.
2. Formal - if there are rules for something here, it doesn’t mean that there’s no room for deliberation, interpretation, judgment, and accountability. The rules here are as light as possible in order to be conducive to good decision-making and good work.

### Committee

The groups that will always be necessary to administer Intersect’s general purposes

1. Administration of Intersect itself
2. Administration of the Cardano public good

Answers primarily to Intersect’s own internal hierarchy and needs.

### Sub-Committee

Any group that helps fulfill Intersect’s purposes in an area of ongoing work, that has a more dynamic definition than committees.

### Working Group

Any subgroup of a committee or subcommittee formed to carry out a specific task over a specific period of time, owned by one member of the parent group and accountable to it.

### Special Interest Group

A group for coordinating people who are interested in a specific topic in a low-stakes and exploratory way.&#x20;

1. This group type is governed by the MCC.&#x20;
2. It is intended to provide an easy way for small groups of members to coordinate without having to meet the standards of a formal subcommittee.

### (Core) Software Group
