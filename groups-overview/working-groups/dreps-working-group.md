# DReps Working Group

## Purpose / Goal

The DRep Working Group is focused on supporting DReps (Delegated Representatives) and preparing them for their crucial role in the budget approval process. This initiative ensures that DReps are well-informed and equipped to participate effectively in reviewing and approving the budget. Given the key responsibility DReps hold within the Cardano ecosystem, this onboarding and education process is essential to maintaining transparency, trust, and informed decision-making during budget approvals.

## Motivation

* Facilitate the onboarding process for new DReps, ensuring they are well-prepared for their responsibilities.
* Provide essential education on the budget approval process, helping DReps understand their critical role.
* Promote informed decision-making through continuous learning and engagement.
* Strengthen transparency and accountability within the budget approval framework.
* Support DReps in building confidence and competence to contribute meaningfully to the Cardano ecosystem.
* Ensure alignment with the broader goals of the Budget Committee and the community's governance framework.
