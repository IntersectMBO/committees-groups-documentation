# TSC - Core Infrastructure Roadmap Working Group

## Purpose / Goal

The purpose of the Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group is to support the following[ Intersect pillars](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) on behalf of Intersect and its membership:

* Intersect Pillar 3: Orchestrate delivery of the community-approved Cardano Roadmap.
* Intersect Pillar 4: Facilitate the continuity of Cardano for system stability.

To date, the simplest way to explain the purpose of this working group is to generate the definitions of scope items, scope categories in a shared Cardano roadmap and to design the process to have the scope items reviewed and ultimately approved for funding.

An attribute of each item on the Roadmap scope is time. Each item will be approved with an expectation of a schedule. Hence, over time the working group will generate a list of items that are scheduled and that gives us the Core Infrastructure Roadmap.
