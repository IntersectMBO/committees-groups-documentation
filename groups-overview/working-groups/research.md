## Objectives

The Intersect Research Working Group aims to establish a robust research agenda centered on sustainability, interoperability, and security to drive Cardano’s growth.

Through conducting fundamental research in areas like consensus algorithms (e.g., Ouroboros Omega), zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-resistant cryptography, and smart contract functionality, the group seeks to enable adoption, resilience, and education within the Cardano ecosystem.

## Priorities

**Cardano Vision**\
\
A five-year vision for Cardano, outlining research priorities, objectives and proposed application areas under a number of thematic focus areas. This plan is informed by Cardano’s tenets, analysis of the research landscape and stakeholder consultations, reflecting on lessons learned over the past seven years to ensure Cardano reinforces its leadership and worldwide adoption.
