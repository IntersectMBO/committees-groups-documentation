# Open Source Project Incubation Working Group

### Purpose/Goals

Establish a clear and efficient process for nurturing and advancing open source projects, ensuring they align with organizational goals and contribute meaningfully to the broader community. This initiative aims to foster a collaborative environment, provide necessary resources, and guide projects toward sustained growth and impact in the open source landscape.

The initial output should be as minimal as possible, but should cover:

* Develop a comprehensive document outlining the step-by-step process for incubating open source projects within the organization. This document should include criteria for project selection, guidelines for community engagement, and a roadmap for project advancement.

Since this is a working group, we should end up with an actual artifact representing our first policy draft.

Items to Note: Projects that are incubating have less policies to follow, more mature projects have more items to adopt
