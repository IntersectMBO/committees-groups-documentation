# TSC - Wallets Working Group

{% hint style="info" %}
Page last updated; 2024-07-29
{% endhint %}

## Purpose / Goal

To further the development of Cardano‚Äôs wallet ecosystem. By providing a place for wallet stakeholders to share insights and work towards solving existing and future problems.

### Motivation

* Unlike other blockchains Cardano has a large and diverse wallet ecosystem, this brings strength via diversification, but introduces complexity in coordination.
* Via the wallets working group, we want to address issues of wallets and their stakeholders.
* By working together we want to be able to tackle the largest and toughest ecosystem-level problems.
* We want to amplify the voice of the quiet, to identify and improve wallets for all.

## Working group deliverables

### Wallets Product Backlog

WIP, dependent on maturity of Cardano backlog committee.

### Wallet Connectors Initiative

* [See folder in shared drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wctnLBRQsEc-kWzDGmaIjLjqci-wtF23?usp=drive_link)
* Cardano does not have an optimal state of connectors.
* The majority of issues on CIPs repo are CIP-30 related.
* Although CIP-30 facilitated the launch of dApps on Cardano, we believe we as an ecosystem are out growing it.
* Once we have described the issue we can then talk about how to solve it.

#### Deliverables

* [CPS-10 | Wallet Connectors](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CPS-0010) ‚úÖ
* CIP-???? | Extensible Wallet Connector Framework ‚è≥
* CIP-???? | Extensible Wallet Connector  Connection - Injected Javascript  ‚è≥
* CIP-???? | Extensible Wallet Connector  API - Legacy Interface  ‚è≥

### Query Layer Initiative

* Lead by Vladimir üí™
* [See folder in shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1baSYHfWJdUh5dwRkHjY7qnaufjuO8sP2?usp=drive_link)
* Cardano lacks a standardized query layer. This can lead to suboptimal tooling, dApp and wallet architecture.
* Every data provider creates its own query layer, this adds complexity to wallets and dApp designs.
* By having a standardized query layer we could allow users to choose data providers for their wallets.

#### Deliverables

* [CPS-12 |](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/625) [Query Layer Standardization](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/625) ‚è≥
