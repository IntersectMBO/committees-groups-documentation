# TSC - Hard Fork Working Group

## Purpose

The Hard Fork working group supports one of Intersect's core pillars: _Orchestrate delivery of the community-approved Cardano Roadmap._

The working group is focussed on the facilitation of upgrades and associated developments, oversee and coordinate issues relating to hard forks, and report status and progress to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), the wider Intersect membership and ecosystem.

The working group aspires to have representation from all stakeholders required to enable a hard fork; from builders, stake-pool-operators, exchanges, as well as members and the broader community. The group is spun up and down dependent on active upgrade proposals.&#x20;

### Why

In order to move and progress Cardano blockchain technology forward, from time to time the Cardano blockchain needs to go through a significant upgrade, this is achieved through a process called a hard fork.

Ultimately hard forks are decided by on-chin governance actions, however coordination and facilitation are necessary in the lead up to any such event.
