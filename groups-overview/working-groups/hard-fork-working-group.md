# TSC - Hard Fork Working Group

## Purpose

The Hard Fork working group supports one of Intersect's core pillars: _Orchestrate delivery of the community-approved Cardano Roadmap._

The working group is focussed on the facilitation of Cardano upgrades and oversee and coordinate issues relating to hard forks. Reporting status and progress to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), the wider Intersect membership and back to hard fork proposers, collaborators and the ecosystem. &#x20;

The working group aspires to have representation from all stakeholders required to enable a hard fork; from builders, stake-pool-operators, exchanges and the broader community.&#x20;

‘A hard fork requires a whole ecosystem, not just a few’.

The group is spun up and down dependent on active upgrade proposals.&#x20;

### Why

In order to move and progress Cardano blockchain technology forward, from time to time the Cardano blockchain needs to go through upgrades, this is achieved through a process called a hard fork.

Ultimately hard forks are decided by on-chin governance actions, however coordination and facilitation are necessary in the lead up to any such event.
