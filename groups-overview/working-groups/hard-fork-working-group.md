# Hard Fork Working Group

## Purpose

The Hard Fork working group supports one of Intersect's core pillars: _Orchestrate delivery of the community-approved Cardano Roadmap._

The working group is focussed on the facilitation of the Chang upgrade and associated developments, oversee and coordinate issues relating to hard forks, and report status and progress to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and the wider Intersect membership. The working group aspires to have representation from all stakeholders required to enable a hard fork; from builders, stake-pool-operators, exchanges, as well as members and the broader community.

### Why

The Voltaire era of Cardano will provide the final pieces required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining system. In order to move to this technology, the Cardano blockchain needs to go through a significant upgrade, this is achieved through a process called a hard fork.

The working group has then been formed to oversee and facilitate the process required to do this upgrade.

## Working group objective / desired outcome

### How will the working group achieve its goals?

The working group will meet with an increasing cadence until the criteria for a hard fork are met. The first condition is to have a node which has all the required new features available. A full list of dependencies are listed and updated with progress on the knowledge base link below.&#x20;

The hard fork working group are directly updating the following main Intersect knowledge base spaces:

{% embed url="https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-upgrades/hard-forks/chang-timeline-and-dependencies" %}

{% embed url="https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-upgrades/hard-forks/hard-fork-frequently-asked-questions" %}

Please note the above pages of the knowledge base will be updated more frequently then this working group page. The working group aspires to work in the open after meetings the above pages are usually updated within 24 working hours.&#x20;

## Learn more and get involved

Regular updates will be provided to Intersect members on the progress of hard fork-related activity, through the TSC, then followed by public updates.
