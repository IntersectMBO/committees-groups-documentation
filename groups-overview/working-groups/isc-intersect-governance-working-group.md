# ISC - Intersect Governance Working Group

### Purpose/Goal

The Intersect Governance Working Group was established by recommendation from the ISC to support and enhance the governance framework of Intersect. Its role is to develop, refine, and recommend governance processes that ensure transparency, accountability, and effective collaboration between Intersect keys stakeholders. While the group does not have decision-making authority, it plays a critical role in shaping governance best practices, aligning committee structures, and fostering strong organizational oversight.

The Intersect Governance Working Group will focus on 4 main areas:

1. Governance Processes & Alignment – Assess and refine governance structures, roles, and workflows to ensure clarity, efficiency, and strategic alignment.
2. Committee Composition & Elections – Improve committee structures, ensure balanced representation, and refine election and nomination processes for committee and board elections.
3. Day-to-Day Governance Support – Provide recommendations to enhance operational governance, compliance, and structured decision-making.
4. Collaboration Between Key Stakeholders – Strengthen coordination and communication between Intersect members, the ISC, Executive Team, and Board to enhance governance effectiveness.

By focusing on these areas, the Governance Working Group helps create a governance framework that is transparent, effective, and aligned with the long-term success of Intersect. The working documents resulting from these areas must be completed by the Governance WG, and all outcomes will be submitted for ratification by the ISC.
